The proposed light rail will help alleviate this issue and bring the area into line with its potential as a major economic hub, connecting it to Parramatta and Macquarie Park. The Mayor of the Hills supports the light rail project between Parramatta and Macquarie Park, citing the need to link residents to their workplaces, places of play, and the region's growing economy. With Parramatta expected to grow to 100,000 workers in 20 years, the Mayor prioritizes this project as the best solution for Western Sydney's transport needs."

The proposed light rail will help alleviate this issue and bring the area into line with its potential as a major economic hub, connecting it to Parramatta and Macquarie Park. The Mayor of the Hills supports the light rail project between Parramatta and Macquarie Park, citing the need to link residents to their workplaces, places of play, and the region's growing economy. With Parramatta expected to grow to 100,000 workers in 20 years, the Mayor prioritizes this project as the best solution for Western Sydney's transport needs."
