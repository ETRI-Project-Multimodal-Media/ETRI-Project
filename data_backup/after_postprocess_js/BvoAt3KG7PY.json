The NVIDIA GeForce GTX 560 Ti outperforms its predecessor, the GTX 460, by 30-35%, and also runs faster than the AMD Radeon HD 6870, but is narrowly outperformed by the HD 6950 1GB card. The Palit and MSI cards, which can reach clock speeds of up to 900 megahertz, run at lower temperatures than their reference design and are priced competitively at $249. The choice to pay more for a graphics card depends on the need for warranty on overclock settings.

The cards offer varying levels of overclocking, with the Palit GTX 560 Ti Sonic boasting the highest clock speeds out of the box at 900 MHz core and 1050 MHz memory. The NVIDIA GeForce GTX 560 Ti outperforms its predecessor, the GTX 460, by 30-35%, and also runs faster than the AMD Radeon HD 6870, but is narrowly outperformed by the HD 6950 1GB card. The Palit and MSI cards, which can reach clock speeds of up to 900 megahertz, run at lower temperatures than their reference design and are priced competitively at $249. The choice to pay more for a graphics card depends on the need for warranty on overclock settings. The three retail cards, Galaxy, MSI, and Pallets, each offer unique features, such as interesting fan design, cool running, and fast out-of-the-box performance."

The cards offer varying levels of overclocking, with the Palit GTX 560 Ti Sonic boasting the highest clock speeds out of the box at 900 MHz core and 1050 MHz memory. The NVIDIA GeForce GTX 560 Ti outperforms its predecessor, the GTX 460, by 30-35%, and also runs faster than the AMD Radeon HD 6870, but is narrowly outperformed by the HD 6950 1GB card. The Palit and MSI cards, which can reach clock speeds of up to 900 megahertz, run at lower temperatures than their reference design and are priced competitively at $249. The choice to pay more for a graphics card depends on the need for warranty on overclock settings. The three retail cards, Galaxy, MSI, and Pallets, each offer unique features, such as interesting fan design, cool running, and fast out-of-the-box performance."

The cards offer varying levels of overclocking, with the Palit GTX 560 Ti Sonic boasting the highest clock speeds out of the box at 900 MHz core and 1050 MHz memory. The NVIDIA GeForce GTX 560 Ti outperforms its predecessor, the GTX 460, by 30-35%, and also runs faster than the AMD Radeon HD 6870, but is narrowly outperformed by the HD 6950 1GB card. The Palit and MSI cards, which can reach clock speeds of up to 900 megahertz, run at lower temperatures than their reference design and are priced competitively at $249. The choice to pay more for a graphics card depends on the need for warranty on overclock settings. The three retail cards, Galaxy, MSI, and Pallets, each offer unique features, such as interesting fan design, cool running, and fast out-of-the-box performance."
