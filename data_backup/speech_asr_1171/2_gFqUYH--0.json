  "transcription": " Hi, my name is Sabrina and I'm a sophomore elementary education major at Illinois State University. In just five days I will be off to study abroad at the University of Cape Town in Cape Town, South Africa. I am so excited to be a study abroad correspondent for Illinois State University and I cannot wait to share my adventures with everyone at home. So I'm going to do a crash course on some of the  essentials I'll be packing for my trip and one thing I won't be packing for my trip. The first two things are journals and a water bottle. The journals are so that I can record every adventure I take and the water bottle is to stay hydrated during the South African summer. Next is my GoPro so I can take epic videos to keep you all updated on my journey. And how could I forget letters from home? I'm gonna be so far away and these letters will provide encouragement for my friends and family. One thing I won't be packing but I wish I were packing is my dog Hazel.  because she'd be the best travel companion and she would fit perfectly in my carry-on. The thing I'm looking forward to the most is seeing Cape Town for the first time. There are mountains, beaches, and to top it off, right now it is summer in Cape Town and I cannot wait to be out of the Chicago winter. In leaving, I will definitely miss my family and friends a ton, but I cannot wait to see what's in store for me in South Africa.  Next time you see me, I will be across the world beginning the adventure of a lifetime. Stay tuned."
