  "transcription": " Nice  I  Well that was terrible But this is the DC-33 that didn't have any tools It was a lot tidier than the other one which I've got over there So I thought well I'll test it out But I'm gonna just set up with the tools from that one This is the original cyclone It's all fine but I've cleaned it and I don't want to mess it up so I decided  I would use my, well the other DC33 cyclone. It's also borrowed a filter, it'll have a new one in before I sell it. But that's all working fine, cost me about £20 to fix. So, yeah, very good. Thank you for watching and we'll see you later. Goodbye."
