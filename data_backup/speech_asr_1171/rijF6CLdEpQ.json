  "transcription": " For me, the holistic framework is a vision or a framework of how knowledge, skills, and practices from four different domains are coordinated to make the learner successful throughout the critical transitions from early elementary up through college and career. These four domains are first, the academic knowledge  and skills like math and science and English language arts. But also the second domain would be social emotional learning. That would include conscientiousness, persistence and other skills. The third domain would be cross-cutting skills. This would be critical thinking and other kinds of skills that cut across what we typically consider academic domains. And then the fourth would be navigation. And navigation combines the other three together  look at how putting them together would make a learner successful at critical transitions, for example, moving from middle school to high school or from high school to college."
