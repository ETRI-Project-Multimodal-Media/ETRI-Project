You can't hit the back at all! I can't!  Go! Catch! Nice!  I'm gonna focus!  This guy is good! This guy is good! Back!  Hey!  Nice!  Backhand? Backhand?  Why don't you move? Hey, Hirata!  Nice!  I'm gonna get you! That was close! Nice! Nice! I feel sorry for you! I know you're not doing it on purpose, but I feel sorry for you! Hina, it's okay. I'll do my best.  It's like a newborn baby squid.  That's it for the two who are not good at backhand! But you were a little bit crazy. No, I wasn't. Let's do it again. Let's do it again. It's better now, right? It's better, indeed. I'm going this way. I'm going this way. Let's do it again. Let's do it again. I'll do it again. If you like this channel, please subscribe and like.
