  "transcription": " Luang Prabang is 400 kilometres from any other major town. So we're a very isolated hospital here. The isolation affects everything that we do. About half the world has little or no access to radiology and medical imaging. Radiology is a piece of so many different  much of the health care system that the absence of it creates a ripple effect in health care disparity.  Radiology files are not like regular images. They're very large files and they have a lot of complicated information inside of that image. As a doctor, you don't want to have to worry whether those images are going to be there or not. You just want that information there. RADiT and Google Cloud are working together to improve health care for low resource and poor regions of the world. What we've done here is  a compact server with access to the cloud. Retrieving from a cloud gives you that power of comparison so that you can see how things are improving or make course corrections if something needs to be changed. The collaboration is constructed so that we can empower the hospitals for long-term self-management of the technologies that we put there. I think that's the real innovation here.  giving hospitals real control over what they do for their patients on a daily basis. Having equal access gives everyone an equal chance. This can help change lives.  you"
