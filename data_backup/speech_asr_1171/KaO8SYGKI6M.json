  "transcription": " Gentlemen, I'm the only authority you will need. I point, you shoot. Did you kill the target? Things over there were different. What we were doing was wrong. You did what you were supposed to do, right? Now the only person you're punishing is yourself. Frank Castle? I got something I need to show you.  I saw the video files. The US military turned you into a hitman, Frank. I'm looking for Frank Castle. The Punisher? I think you know about my case. Castle's the last witness. We can either clean this up or let him take us down. They killed my family to get to me. You have nothing but a war inside you.  You're gonna pay. Stay out of my way. This is not your fight. I need to find these bastards and I gotta kill them. So where does that take us?  and Frank. What if you're exposed to them? These men, they decide what the truth is. The same thing that happened to you happened to me. We could make that right.  The world needs to see the truth."
