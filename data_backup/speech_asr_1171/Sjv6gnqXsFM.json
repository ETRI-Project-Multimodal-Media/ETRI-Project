  "transcription": " The Superlift Hot Springs race course is really, really cool. I'm excited about it. It's really tight woods racing and it's going to be a driver's race for sure.  Major rocks, got major ledges, and it rained yesterday. It rained about an inch yesterday, so everything's wet. So water plays a big part out here in Hot Springs. All the ledges and stuff, you got water running down on them. So it's gonna make it interesting.  so  Shannon starting in the back, that's going to put a new game plan. You know you got Lauren Haley and Shannon are both very very fast competitors. We had a really great qualifying course run going and everything kind of fell apart on me right at the end we smacked right up the waterfall no problem.  shot us from the top and just took a bad bounce, landed right on the belly, wedged in between our upper links and we couldn't move. I mean, all the tires were off the ground and we weren't going anywhere. So we're starting in the very back.  Oh  so  Lauren Healey and all them boys was giving me a hard time about driving my car too hard and qualifying. So I kind of took what they said and thought about it. You know, set a good pace, you know,  and it ended up working out, so many of them boys wasn't all wrong. I'm excited about tonight's shootout. I mean, honestly, I came down here to run this race, but this was always in the back of my mind, keep the car together so we can run tonight. Last year, we were second place, right behind Shannon Campbell. And it's kind of cool to see the two different thoughts and schools come together for one event and see what comes out on top. Last year was an ultra four car. Hopefully, we can keep it that way this year. We'll take it home. If it ain't today, we'll take it home.  The next one or the next one, a bouncer will take it home before long and I have a feeling it might be today.  That feels good.  so  you"
