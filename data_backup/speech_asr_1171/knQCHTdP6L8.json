  "transcription": " Inside my heart I'm on my way back to California  I never planned to stay away from California Oh baby, please don't get me wrong My heart's confessing in this song Inside my heart I'm on the plane  Farewell to the snow and the rain Inside my heart I'm on my way Back to California You know I never planned to stay Away from California  I miss my beloved Golden State The sand, the waves, the golden gate The setting sun bathes in the sea Cold winter winds were not meant for me  I miss the sand between my toes  The time has come for me to go A one-way ticket's in my hand And I'll be home when this murder ends Inside the plane I'm on my way back to California  You know I never planned to stay away from California I'm going home Next time, a damn rubber band, man."
