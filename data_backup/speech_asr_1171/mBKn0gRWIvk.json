  "transcription": " Oh, you made it! That must have been a really tight squeeze going down that golf hole. Who are you? I'm Alice. Well, you can't sit down. You haven't been invited. I sent in my registration form weeks ago. Well, you're most welcome then. There's always time for tea or beer or wine.  Why is a raven like a writing desk? Or having the slightest idea? What a relatively large head you have. I would very much like to hat it. Oh, thank you. Where are you going? To the tea. Oh, you're going golfing? Yes. I guess that makes sense. You have to be as mad as a hatter to play this game. We'll see you next Tuesday.  Fire!"
