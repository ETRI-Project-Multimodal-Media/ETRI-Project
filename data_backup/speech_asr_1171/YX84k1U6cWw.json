  "transcription": " I'm Jackson Burns, I'm a Redneck Archaeologist. I'm somewhere out here in Texas. I ain't gonna tell you where. I'm out here by myself. We got people up there. We're waiting on  a movie star, TV star to show up. But right now I'm looking for a chupacabra and that's what he's coming for. If he ever drags his ass in here. And the game plan is today we're supposed to be trying to find a chupacabra. Now I'm the only one out here and it's high noon. I'm the only one looking.  I'll keep looking by myself Here we go Yeah, hey I'm a couple of times. I mean that one time we were this close and he looked just like that. That's why I said that's how I wanted mounted. Like I said, the curvature is fine. Oh, unbelievable. And see when I first saw him walking the first time I thought that his legs were broken.  Yeah, because you know the gate and it would be no different if you and I went to walk on all fours.  I think I need to...  Combat medic. Oh, sacks on the back. And it seems like everybody I've talked to it all happened. It did. Everybody that calls me, you know, they're like, oh my God, I saw one of those. And it's all in that same time frame. So normally something hybridizes and it doesn't, it can't reproduce. That's right. And yeah, that, that's why, you know, we wonder here because  I think when this one was killed and the other ones were killed, all of them were male. I think the two young ones were the offspring. Somebody got one and threw it in the river and then the other one the guy burned. And then I have two. I have this full body mount and the other one I just have a head mount. I didn't bring it because this is... and I regret not doing the first medical body.  oh  I saw him it was either early morning or late evening."
