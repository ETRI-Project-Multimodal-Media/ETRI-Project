  "transcription": " Satsang with Mooji  I've never known and I've never understood If mom could turn me, it would be you When I was sick, it might be great Having her to take care of me  I begin to think she has left me If dad was here with me when I get bullied I do believe he would protect me I'm sure my dear dad loved dad also concerned about me But he has gone before I was born  Oh  I do support for me have both mom and dad that absolutely joyful and warm the moment they're all happy but I'm lonesome I wish you were right here by me now even I cry mom  Had'a I'm a sinner, and I'm so grateful to Allah  My dear, mom, I'm dying missing you I feel so lonely, I need you the most Daddy, I'm missing you so much it hurts There's no embrace of this warm and compact Others apart from me  I  grateful to Allah  Oh  you"
