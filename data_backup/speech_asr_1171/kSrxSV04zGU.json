  "transcription": " Beligered France coach Raymond Domenech faced the press in Blomfontein after his troubled squad flew into the city 24 hours ahead of their crucial Group A clash against host South Africa. Coach Domenech was the first off the plane, his striking players only descending after a wait of several minutes. As the team walked to the bus they avoided the media attention that their protest against the expulsion of striker Nicolas Anelkers caused. The Chelsea striker was sent home for verbally abusing Domenech at half-time during their 2-0 win.  defeat to Mexico. Anelka refused to apologize when asked to by the French Football Federation. First of all, I would like to say that the sanctions against Nicolas Anelka were justified and that I support the Federation in its decision. No one has the right, no one should be allowed to behave in such a manner. Biliga Dominic reacted evasively to claims that some of his players may refuse to face South Africa because of Anelka's expulsion from the squad.  French fans arriving in Blomfontein are worried that the team strike is ruining their remaining chances, albeit slim, of qualifying for the round of 16. I think that, of course, it will affect the team. You can't prepare well for the game. Above all, a game which is the last and there is still a chance of qualifying. Now it is going to be very, very difficult. French Sports Minister Rosaline Bachelot is due to hold talks with Domenech and his players to try and heal the rift, which is seen as damaging to France's  his international image."
