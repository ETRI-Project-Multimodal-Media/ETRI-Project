You've still got to try I've got a few comments before here and not like I don't get a lot but I get some and some of those stupidest things and like I got this really bad one and go die and I was like oh wow okay, and then when I checked on the channel in the recent updates like the feed like what they've been doing like the recent activity they've sent it to a lot of people like the same message so Some of the hate that you get will just be the same and you've been spamming it about if they say something don't react back just block them  or just yeah just block them. Take no notice, delete the comment or something and focus more on the positive comments because you might have like loads of positive comments then one crappy negative comment and you'll focus on the negative comment more. Try to really do that because internet hate sucks. I'm not gonna lie, it sucks. And people say, oh I love my hairs. No you don't, you're lying, no you don't. It's like hard to talk about. So yeah just try to ignore it, don't take any notice even though sometimes it's hard, just try your best. Ignore the comments and focus more on the positive ones.  because you've got to love you. Try not to focus on the little things, focus on the love. That's right. I love you, I'm Lewis, I love you, and yeah, bye. Peace!"
