The street is always packed with people and here you can find various stalls along with lots of street performers.  Relax for the day in one of the city centre's famous parks. These include Gowdy's Park Well, where you'll find a famous lizard statue and the winding park bench bunk to Trinkedies. Another park worth visiting is Park Della Ciutadella, where you'll find the breathtaking Cascada Fountain. A single journey on Bracknell's  Barcelona's metro will cost you around 1.50 Euro, but rather than buying individual tickets for each journey, buy yourself a T10 that costs about 8 Euro and will give you 10 journeys. As Barcelona is quite big, you'll definitely use the metro at some stage, and there are stops throughout the city. Come down here to Can Pacciono in the Barcelona area of the city where you will get cheap  of the cave once you've eaten. Salud! You'll find this popular tapas bar on Carrer de la Reina Cristina. If the sun is shining, don't forget that Barcelona city centre is just 15 minutes walk from the beach. During the summer, thousands flock here every day.  And finally, another great way to save money in Barcelona is by staying in hostels rather than hotels. And to book this hostel here called Centric Point, which you can find on Passa de la Gracia in the heart of Barcelona city centre and many more, log on to www.hostelworld.com.  I'm out."
