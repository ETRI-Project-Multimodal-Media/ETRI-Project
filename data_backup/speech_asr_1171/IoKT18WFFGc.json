  "transcription": " Some people say that goon is just a cheap box of wine, but to us it's a box of dreams.  Put the nozzle to my lips, see how that box hide Tastes so sweet, doves would bloody cry Then he took it away, the moment gone too soon I will never forget my first sip of goon How did I survive, how did I survive without that nectar? Now it's time to thrive, time to come alive My life is complete!  I love it, it's good Every weekend we were chippin' for some grog While some had the cruises, we had the box It's a drink you can share so cheap you don't care The nectar of God's all I need, I like it Sleep on the silver pillow if you don't have a bed Sleep on the silver pillow as you're weary head Pudding likes you, makes you sexier, I wish Cause if that was the case I'd be a supermodel bitch How did I survive, how did I survive without that nectar?  Now it's time to thrive, time to come alive My life is complete  It's goon, baby, I love you  Swing that fuck around and round It's good to fortune good to not Do your memory say goodbye Take a sip and swing it down Swing that fuck around and round It's good to fortune good to not Do your memory say goodbye Take a sip and swing it down Swing that fuck around and round It's good to fortune good to not Do your memory say goodbye Take a sip and swing it down Swing that fuck around and round It's good to fortune good to not Do your memory say goodbye Do your memory say goodbye Do your memory say goodbye  We say goodbye, goodbye, it's good how I love it, it's good how I love it, it's good how I love it, it's good how I love it, it's good how I love it, it's good how I love it, it's good how I love it, it's good how I love it, it's good how I love it, it's good how I love it, it's good how I love it, it's good  I drink goon every fucking day  I drink good every fucking day. I drink good every fucking day."
