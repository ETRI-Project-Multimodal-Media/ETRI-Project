  "transcription": " Hey guys, it's Haley here and in today's video we're going to be making a DIY EOS acne spot treatment which is awesome for treating and preventing pimples. So let's just get into it. Also, please excuse my ratchet nails in this video, just saying they're bad. So the ingredients that you're going to need for this DIY EOS acne stick are tea tree oil which is going to act as the main pimple fighting ingredient in this acne stick, coconut oil which is going to prevent the tea tree oil from drying out our skin too much,  much  30 seconds till it was all melted up. Then I added in 6 drops of tea tree oil into the mixture, but you can honestly vary this amount depending on what you think you need. And I'm so dumb, I forgot to film the part of me adding the vitamin E oil, but I added about a quarter teaspoon. And then I poured the entire mixture into the EOS lid. And the level of the mixture should be above the grate. Then after putting it in the freezer for about half an hour, this is what I ended up  I then just aligned the indents on the lid and the base and I popped them together. And when you unscrew the lid you should have a perfect DIY EOS acne spot treatment.  I actually made another DIY lip balm video a really long time ago, about a year ago. And at the time I thought I was the first person ever to do it, but turns out I think there was somebody else who did it before me. So if you want to see little Hailey's dream get crushed, then watch this video. Just kidding! I'll link it like here-ish. So yeah, go watch that. And you can laugh at fetus Hailey because I was such a fetus. Yeah.  with you because it's super portable and it's also great because it doesn't look like an acne stick so if you just like have it in your purse no one's gonna question it. So I really hope that you guys can make this yourselves and it really works for you. And I will see you guys all in my next video. Bye!  you"
