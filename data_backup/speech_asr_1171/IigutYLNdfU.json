  "transcription": " Hey. Cass, what is that? It's your spell of gathering. Are you nuts? You're not strong enough. Cass, you could get hurt. You find a better option? No, but without a serious boost to your angel power, that spell won't even work. Strength may surprise you. Wait a second.  Remember, Bobby told me when you needed strength to retrieve us from the past, you used him to power up. You touched his soul, right? That's right, I did that. But that procedure can be fatal. Use my soul. Go away. Maybe you'll have enough power to wield the spell. That isn't necessary. It's worth the risk. Cassidine needs Aurichil. I trust you.  What?  and I'll use your spell to blast through the warding and retrieve Dean and the Hand of God. And then when Dean comes back and he finds this place decorated with your guts, I will tell him the truth, Sam. I'll just say, Dean. Dean. He knew the risks. He wouldn't take no for an answer.  in the flesh."
