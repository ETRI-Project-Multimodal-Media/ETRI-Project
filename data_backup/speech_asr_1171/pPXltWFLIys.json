  "transcription": " Music stations made for every mood. Blinkbox Music sponsors The Big Reunion. The Big Reunion is back and six bands from the 90s and noughties are reuniting to perform at a monumental pop extravaganza.  We really want to do this. Nothing compares to being out there on stage in front of 20,000. Nothing comes close. But after more than a decade apart, will it be a regrettable shambles? We've all got bad backs, you know, dodgy knees. It's going to be terrible. I have no idea what we are going to look like as a band, and that scares the shit out of me. This is the big reunion. I always felt like there should be that happy ending, that here's the grand finale.  And the 3T chaps were on best behavior  as dad Tito Jackson arrives in town. I can't believe you had 12 shots. Yeah, 12 shots pops. I'm not exaggerating either. I wish I was. I wanted to see how many extra, I thought I was in... He don't waste it. My brother's an alcoholic. I'm not. I'm watching you.  go to itv.com forward slash big reunion next on itv2 matt edmonson and the fake reaction gang are here with our friend dane bowers getting up to the usual oddness like eating awful burgers see ya Potato Blink fast music sponsors the big reunion"
