  "transcription": " Right I bought this anti-gravity battery quick start over two months ago never tried it and it's supposed to start the VA we're going to find out this is a brand new 434 I've got it out the garage and the battery's gone flat I'm going to totally disconnect the battery and put this on together  I hope you can see that. That is the battery totally isolated and it's going to try it just on that. Well, I'm quite amazed. It works, we will try it again.  One more for that, just to prove a point. Well, that does prove it works."
