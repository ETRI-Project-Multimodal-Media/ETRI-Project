  "transcription": " Hi, my name is Elise. I'm from the Eta Kappa chapter of Zeta Phi Beta Sorority Incorporated. I'm in my second year right now, and the fallout being my third. Strolling to me, personally, is just a form of expression. I feel like every org has their own personality and their own twist to it, and I feel like it's more of history behind it. Some of the songs that we stroll to is like a kind of show that we do with other orgs that kind of brings us together, which is Swag Surf,  Of course, Wipe Me Down. You see those two songs come out in the parties or anything, definitely gonna see all the Greeks running. You're gonna hear the alphas whistle, you're gonna hear us Z-fying and going straight to the middle to stroll to. That's more like a culture like Greek song that is. One of our important songs that we kind of do is Candy. Candy, which is one of my favorite strolls, is definitely a Zeta stroll song that definitely we use for it.  I love strolling because I have a really big personality one and I think it's a really good form of expression to do that I feel like you can use strolling especially to represent The culture that really goes deep behind sororities and fraternities. I feel like that's very important when you're talking about When it comes to like strolling and the reasons for it I feel like it's a privilege for me to be able to stroll to such a wonderful organization and I very much very very much enjoy it  Bye! So sweet, sweet, sweet."
