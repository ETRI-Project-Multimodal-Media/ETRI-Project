You will need a component that's been pre-studded to have that rock and roll look. It's also been pre-wired so that we can make our earring. You'll also need a  We also need an oval shaped jump ring that has been pre-cut so that we can open it to add our fish hook and our earring. Again, I'm choosing to use my flat nose pliers. I'm going to look for the pre-cut hole so that I can open it so that I can attach my component, which is my studded earring. I'm going to add the wires to the jump ring  ring and then I'm going to close the jump ring. I'm going to pick up another jump ring. Again, look for the pre-cut hole so we can separate it which will allow us to then bead it through our prior jump ring. Then we're going to add our fish hook ear wire.  These are very tiny. At this point I'm going to use my needle nose pliers to help me grasp the very tiny jump ring to make a nice closure. Carefully lining up the two ends. Once that is done, you have rock and roll earrings. After we've added our fish hook wire, ear wire, we are finished and we have  have our studded rock and roll earring. Now you have a beautiful design idea for rock and roll jewelry."
