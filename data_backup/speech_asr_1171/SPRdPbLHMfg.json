  "transcription": " My name is Omer and I'm studying Music and Sound for Image BA Hons. I'm very passionate about Music and Sound for Image because music has been the one thing that has stuck with me throughout my whole life. I decided to study at Huddersfield because the facilities here are some of the best in the country and the tutors here are some of the best professionals in their field. Nowhere else in the country really offers a course quite like this.  course I realised just how much an impact music can make in a film. If it fits just right it can further enhance what the film is actually trying to convey. The University has really laid the foundations for me because it's really helped me realise my potential. I'm currently applying for a master's degree at the National Film and Television School and the ultimate dream is to become a professional composer."
