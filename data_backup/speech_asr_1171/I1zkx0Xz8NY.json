  "transcription": " Michelle's taking me to the Superbike World Championship in Laguna Seca. We're talking 22 riders from seven countries all vying to be the Superbike Champion of the World. Can we hop on and get out there? Yeah, let's do it. Sweet.  When did inspiration strike to get on two wheels and actually make it happen? It's Genghis's fault. Your buddy, not the conk? Yeah, my buddy. He was talking to me about all the bike treks that he does and all the beautiful nature he gets to explore. I'm all about absorbing what's left of it, as long as it's still beautiful. It's like a meditation, isn't it? You know, once you're free and you're out on the road and you got a good ride ahead of you, it's a beautiful thing. You punctuate with moments like this. Yeah.  Yeah! Woo! You look impressive as s*** on this bike. Are you kidding? No, you look like a Garnier Fructis commercial. Oh, you're hilarious. It's perfect. I just don't care what I look like as long as I'm having fun. That's the way to do it. This is incredible. It is, isn't it? You rode on this all yesterday?  Yeah, I love this thing. This Ducati Diavel is one of the best cruisers on the market. It's got a 162 horsepower engine and a top speed of 169 miles per hour. It just does what you want it to. It's like riding a horse. Like, you know, you move and it just listens. I'm just getting used to the clutch and the brake and the difference between the two. Well, that is kind of an important thing to know before you hop on. I know I trained for a month before I got on the bike.  Did you work with a private instructor or did you go to one of the public? Yeah, I definitely did. I didn't just get on a bike cold, you know? I take it seriously. I treat this like a gun. As you should. A lot of respect."
