  "transcription": " Devin Aroma Shadoo isn't in uniform, but there's no fooling these kids who recognize number 19 even without his blue and orange. And they can't get enough of the Bears wide receiver who came by the Chicago parent offices this fall to shoot our December cover. The shoot was a blast, the end product predictably adorable,  and the 24-year-old star humble and heartfelt as he talked about his work with kids from the Chicago Housing Authority.  Each got $250 to spend and a memory they'll have forever.  ChicagoParent.com slash hometown heroes."
