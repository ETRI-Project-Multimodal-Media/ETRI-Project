Hi, I'm Sameer Puri from the Pilates Studio.  the Campus Spinsat Girls 2016 was we just had a fitness competition which is called the Miss Iron Maiden Contest. It really went off very well, though I would definitely say that fitness looks like it's not the priority amongst the girls, but I just hope they'll learn from this and take this to another level as far as fitness goes. The top four or five were really good, really difficult to differentiate from them, but eventually I should have did a  and she came out on top. So well done Aishwarya. And after this I think the next stage is the 9th auditions and I hope our girls do well and go into the main competition. Thank you.  Thank you sir  actually and it was great, it was a very refreshing event."
