I was not a member of the group in the OBOZ group or in the Ministry of Agriculture before I was elected. Compared to when we used to do it before, funds have been a major challenge and sourcing for funds to be able to meet up with this kind of capacity of 2,000, 2,500 beds will require as much as 1.5 million at the minimum. But the intervention of the state government was quite helpful. They provided the funds.  Not only that, they also provide a team that will supervise our activities. So from time to time, they also come around, inspect, remind us of what things need to be done, and then we have vet doctors that are supervising this project too. By and large, you can say that it's been a very, very rewarding and helpful provision from the state government.  The birds here are just 37-day-olds today and you can see each and every one of them are almost 2 kg by now.  by the scale man is readily available. So we just pick them, then we start the walk.  you"
