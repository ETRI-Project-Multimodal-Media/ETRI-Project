  "transcription": " This is in Torvalay. Oh, wind surfers! Amazing! It's so windy. You can probably hear it. The speed they go at is astonishing. I want to try it next year!  This is on Lake Garda and this particular place, Torvolets, is said to be very windy and that's why it's popular for wade sailing and surfing. It's fantastic I must return"
