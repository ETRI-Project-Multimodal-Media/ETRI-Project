We would now like to invite some friends to speak about how the season went down.  Do y'all remember when we ran the ball on 4th and 24? Come out, come out, come out! Come out boys. Alright boys. 6-12 wheel, 6-12 wheel. 4th and 24, I don't think we should pass it. Alright? We're gonna run 22, we're running the ball. Yetter, I need you to get it, you need to run fast. Yes sir, yes sir. 24 yards son, 24 yards. Ready? On the ball, ready?  Let's go! Do y'all remember in spring ball last year when  that middle school soccer ref tried to kick us off the field and coach Gibson put him in this place. Hey, eyes up, eyes up. Great practice out there today boys. Taun, great effort son. Hey coach, I need you off the field. Son, we got five more minutes. Coach, I gotta have you off the field. The girls gotta warm up. I said we have five more minutes. Who's the AD around here? I'm the AD.  Do y'all remember at Toyota Stadium when Coach Harper got so mad he punched a wall? Alright, QB sneak, that's beating us. We can fix that. Cover two, drop back, drop back. Check tank, we won't get off on the running back. There's one thing that's beating us. Stop.  Being soft. SOFT! You're getting soft! You play harder than that! Don't give up! Come on! We can still win this! Do y'all remember when Coach Nicholson raged on the sideline every single game?  Let's go have a good game. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Yeah, good game to play. It's our first game of the season. Let's go have a great game. We got to win the game. Stop. Dude, look.  Dang it, Mason! Hey guys, I love you guys.  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming. It's time to bury the season.  staff and all the trainers for everything that they've done for us this year. Thank you. Thank you!"
