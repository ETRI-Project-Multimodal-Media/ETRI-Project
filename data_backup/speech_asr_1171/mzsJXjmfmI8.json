  "transcription": " Hey guys, welcome to my new vlog today. Today is all about home shooting. So, Katerina, a friend of mine is coming and we're going to use this room right here as a shooting location because the weather is not very good today. So my today's equipment is the Fujifilm X-T2 with the 23mm lens f.2. Also going to use the 56mm lens  with f1.2. Tess! Hey! It's good? It's good.  So, we just got back from the beach.  Just finished the shoot. Now we're going to do some lunch. What I've learned today is that you can use the IKEA table as a black backdrop. Also haven't blocked everything today because I didn't want to interrupt our shoot with all the different settings with a vlog camera.  and also was pretty sensual and we got a lot of good pictures and I'm going to show you a couple of these right now and if you like what you've seen or if you want to see more behind the scenes videos let me know in the comments and please subscribe  me do me"
