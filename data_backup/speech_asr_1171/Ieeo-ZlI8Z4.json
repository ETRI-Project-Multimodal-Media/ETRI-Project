  "transcription": " Taste and see Tampa Bay's water adventures are powered by Freedom Boat Club of Tampa Bay.  When you join the Freedom Family, you're joining much more than just a boat club. You're joining into a lifestyle. This weekend you have the ability to grab a boat, run out to Beer Can Island, and don't let it stop you.  stop at the water's edge. It's a good time. It's a good time to be out in the sun and a bunch of fun people, a lot of good energy. It is about fun in the sun. It is about food and drink. It's about family. It's about friends. It's about coming together and being a community."
