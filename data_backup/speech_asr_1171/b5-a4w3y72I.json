  "transcription": " By almost any measure, West Vancouver is one of Canada's safest communities. West Vancouver residents enjoy one of the lowest crime rates in Metro Vancouver. Our crime severity index is consistently amongst the lowest in British Columbia and across Canada. The West Vancouver Police Department is proud to support the work of the police department.  of that reputation and we know that the communities that we serve are just as proud. Because of our safe community some might think we don't have much to do. That the WVPD can keep doing things the way we've always done them. That the WVPD should just focus on maintaining the status quo. That the WVPD should be satisfied holding the line on crime.  The GPD can afford to take it easy. But that's not the way we do things in West Vancouver. We don't believe in the status quo. We don't just hold the line. We don't take it easy. And we've got lots to do. The question that we ask ourselves every single day, how do we make a community that is safe today, safer tomorrow?  By making safer roads. By making safer homes. By making safer businesses. By making safer schools. By making safer neighborhoods. By making safer communities. Just watch us. Just watch us. Just watch us.  Visit us at WBPD.ca. Find us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram."
