For 2017, things start out bright and early. The Bushman 250 will be the kick-off event on the 25th of March down in Escort. Then we're going to be traveling the length and breadth, the tail end of summer and all the way through the thick of winter before we arrive at the very final event that's going to be early in November.  before we can name who will be 2017 champions. Join us as once again we explore the amazing terrain that KZN has to offer. There will be racing, there will be camaraderie, there will be good and bad times in equal measure, but there will always be off-road racing.  information log on to www.nataloffroad.co.za and come play with us. We hope to see you guys out there at the end of March in escort for the Blue Rock Quarry Bushman's 250."
