Look at this! It's a toilet! What is this? It's a right garden!  There's shampoo and stuff What is this red bag? Do you want to zoom in? What is this? So I asked the mountain chief to open the bag It's a bit scary to touch it What is this? There's something inside! There's something white inside! Wait, wait, can I open it? I'll open it What is this?  What is it? What is it? Toilet paper! It was toilet paper! It's flowing! It's flowing! Isn't it supposed to be here? Isn't it supposed to be here? The answer is toilet paper! I wonder how many people got it right? Bye bye!"
