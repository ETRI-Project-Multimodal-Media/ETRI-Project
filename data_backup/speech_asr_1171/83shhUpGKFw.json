  "transcription": " Sun, sandcastles, arts and culture. It's all just a short ride away from Orlando on the Gulf Coast. Cut loose, enjoy some surf, or even meet a surprising celebrity.  Winter wears her tail about an hour a day, but even without it, she is more than happy to show me some of her moves and even lets me steal a kiss. You'd be hard-pressed to find a better place for a little R&R, but if you're looking for some action, you can find that here, too.  For fans of art and eye candy, there's the Dali Museum in St. Petersburg with an unparalleled collection of art by surrealist Salvador Dali. You're sure to be amazed, shocked, and above all, inspired. This is what they call the wishing tree here at the Dali Museum. I've made a wish. I would tell you what mine is.  I can't, because you know what they say, it might not come true. Celebrate the end of the day with sunsets at Pier 60. Maybe even take a little piece of the Gulf Coast home. For a natural break from all of Orlando's action, head to the Gulf Coast. Sun, sand, and culture. It's all here. For more information, visit westjetvacations.com or call your travel agent.  you"
