  "transcription": " Hello, my name is Robert and I'm from Carphone Warehouse in Lakeside. Today's feature I'm going to demo is on the iPhone 4. The feature is the video recording. Now currently, the screen at the moment is on a default mode. Now when you're video recording, it won't show you exactly what you're video recording. You're actually videoing a bit more than that. Now what most people don't tend to know is if you double tap the screen, it will actually widen. So it actually will give you more perspective of actually what you're viewing rather than actually what you're seeing when you're recording.  in that mode. That is the eye opener for the iPhone 4."
