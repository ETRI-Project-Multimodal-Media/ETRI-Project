  "transcription": " Let me back up for him, let me back up, yo, yo.  I'll carve scars on your ma with bizarre cars  She looks chocolate so me and her is sharing a twirl I'm nonchalantly bad to anyone who steps in my fam And I'll have them shaking in the booth just like a scared little girl Too many rappers acting fanny with their girly ways They're chatting shit I'm on the door to turn these turds away I'm never fake I'll demonstrate the way I burn a page And terminate the best of them The rest of them get early grades Don't be brave because I gave the bird a pearly chain She's got some juicy knuckles so I splurted on the virgin's face  Send that skit away so I can lay in smoke And here's a few guys cheering, one five collabing on the 1st of May I bum like 9-11, flying round in Porsches Fuck being cautious, I'm taking no precautions Leaving niggas nauseous, performing for chorus I'm balling, leave these faggots orphaned in shoreditch Cause I'm a bastard, sarcastic and morbid Walking a stall with a sword that's enormous I'll cut corners, of course it's the rawest These others do little like they're talking to horses  We got that high grade music Shit you can't move shit Five eight zoo shit I write bars on the cars then Hard shit, old school in the lasades We got that high grade music Shit you can't move shit Five eight zoo shit I write bars on the cars then Hard shit, old school in the lasades We got that high grade music Shit you can't move shit Five eight zoo shit  I write bars on the cars and hard shit Old school, Linda Lusadi We got that high grade music Shit you can't move shit 5-8-2 shit, shit I write bars on the toilet  Those pups are very very powerful."
