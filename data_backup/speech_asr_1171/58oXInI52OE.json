And that's a good thing because it helps reduce heating costs and keeps your home more comfortable to live in. But it also means that it's harder for fresh air to get into your house and for stale or humid air to get out. In older homes, leaks may provide some ventilation, but these leaks may cause drafts and the effects are localized and impossible to control.  window when the weather's nice, but if you try that in the winter, you'll have higher heating bills. Your best bet is to use a heat recovery ventilator or HRV. An HRV is like lungs for your home. It has two air streams, one to bring fresh air into the home and the other to expel stale, moist air to the outdoors. It also has the added benefit of capturing heat from the outgoing air and transferring it to the air coming in. Compared to opening windows and using kitchen and bathroom fans, HRVs ventilate while keeping some of that heat  you've already paid for. HRVs send warm incoming air to your furnace for circulation throughout the house. In homes with baseboard or radiant heating, the warm, fresh air is delivered directly to each room. To balance things, stale air is drawn from the kitchen and bathroom areas and vented outdoors. HRVs are common in energy-efficient houses but can also benefit older homes. Proper design, location and balancing of the system are essential. Make sure your new system  is installed by a certified contractor and for energy efficiency choose a unit with the ENERGY STAR logo.
