  "transcription": " Hey, Sean here, the site director of violinstringreview.com.  violinist Joshua Bell. The biggest issue that many people have is that the Evaprazzi can feel a bit too high tension and bright for many players. The Evaprazzi Gold seems to have set out to fix this. Perestro claims that these strings have an even shorter break in time than Evaprazzi and Obligato, and have a complex tone rich with overtones, outstanding response, and outstanding tuning stability. Before I go into the sound, let's check out what everyone's interested in, how it looks.  and  and reminds me of the hill E on steroids. Again, it doesn't blend with the rest of the set, but as the soloist string, it allows for very nuanced and projecting solo passages. These strings are very rich. I wouldn't say they're as lush as a set of gut strings, or possibly even obbligato. I do not feel that anyone would be at risk of these strings being too complex. They have a very nice balance and not being too extreme one way or the other. Overall, these are fantastic strings that would make most violinists happy. My violin likes a very neutral string, and I would almost call these neutral plus. Every aspect of my violin, whether it be projection, tone, richness, or responsiveness, is a hair above what I would expect.  from other synthetic strings, and not going to an extreme where I feel it would be out of place if I jumped from orchestra to chamber to solo playing. They certainly do keep much of the good qualities of original Ivor Prazi, but give more room to speak.
