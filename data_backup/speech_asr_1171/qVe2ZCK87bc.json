  "transcription": " So about three or four tables full of produce. This is the produce that's come from our three separate farms. But instead of having farmers there selling their own goods, we have students selling it. So we're going to have a whole bunch of volunteers who are going to be educating people on the health benefits, how to use these vegetables, how to cook them. We're going to have people educating others on sustainability and how local food ties into the sustainability movement. And then we'll have the people who are going to be  people who are actually selling the food. A lot of it comes down to my experience at McMaster, that I would take the bus on weekends to go down to the farmers market and then as I got busier and busier I kept doing that less and less. And so it was really discouraging that someone like me who is so passionate about eating locally, about having sustainable options, about eating healthy, was doing it less than I should be because it takes a long time. So convenience is a really huge factor here. Not only is it easier for people to access this food, but it's also opening up  this wide breadth of knowledge to a whole new group of students who might not know that much about why eat local or might not even know that much about eating vegetables. I was talking to someone earlier today and they said, well at university you eat Kraft dinner and pizza, right? And that's something personally I'd love to see us move away from. Students spend most of their time challenging their brains and in order to really function at an optimum level, they need healthy food.  you"
