  "transcription": " That's right, Tristan is the grandson of this little girl, Stephanie Williams, one of the funniest kids who ever appeared on Art Link Letters Classic Show.  Well done, Redbeard. You girls came from a rare race. Let's bring her in here. Stephanie, come on over. Hi. Nice to meet you. What a black and pink. You look like you're going to be in this episode, too. I know. You thought it was just going to be you, huh? Stephanie, tell me about your experience with Art Linklater. What was that like? Even as old as I am, I remember it like it was yesterday, because he was really, really nice to us and very sweet.  It was just real natural, you know, he made us comfortable and stuff and it was great. It was really good. Who you gonna marry? I don't know his name. Where is he? Next to me. Michael, meet Stephanie Williams. Hello. She's gonna marry you, so you ought to know her. Or do you have a girlfriend, Michael? Yes. Oh, you have another girl?  So you might not marry, Stephanie? Who do you think's gonna win you? The other girlfriend, because she got a big mouth. What's that? I got a bigger mouth than her. Stephanie, let me ask you this. Did your parents give you any advice before you went on the show? Yes. The main thing they told me is, keep your legs straight,  and pull your dress down, that actually lasts for your whole life. Oh, yeah! I love that. I love that."
