It's like mamita, that's what we're looking for right there. So this is what we're gonna do, place it in the flour. This is not any ordinary flour. It has garlic powder, it has onion powder, it has pepper, it has a little bit of paprika. And you are going to take it and you're going to actually lather the flour and you're gonna dust it off, knock off the excess flour. You want your chicken to actually be crunchy, but from skin, not from flour.  it into the hot grease and you can use vegetable oil or canola oil. I'm going to slice the green onions. Technically it's a thin slice but you can actually call it a mince and you take them and you shiver them all the way down.  You want to build a mound. Building a mound will help you chop up your ingredients, which would be the parsley. You talk to the chicken, you love the chicken, the chicken's gonna love you, and you're gonna love it back. That's what we're looking for right there. Spanish fried chicken actually are a signature piece of mine, and I am very happy to introduce you to them.  This is Chef Mia and Team Elite Six here to empower your lifestyle."
