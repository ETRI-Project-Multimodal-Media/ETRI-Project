  "transcription": " Hey guys, um, okay, so my dog is on heat which means she's got her period and therefore I need to try and put a diaper on her. So that's the diaper, that's how it looks and I think you need to, the tail needs to go through here, type of thing. So,  I think it's gonna be amusing and that's why I decided to try and record it if my dog will let me so we'll see how that goes  Now that. That now the full.  Now I'm full.  dog with a diaper I think she needs some time to get used to it  but uh yeah so that's what happens when your dog is in heat yeah that's not gonna work  Hey guys, so just a quick note. I want to make sure that everyone understands that No animals were hurt During this video. I did not hurt my dog. I'm really strongly against  against animal cruelty or animal abuse. The only reason why I put the diaper on her is so that she'll feel more comfortable with herself while she's on heat and that there won't be any huge mess in the apartment. So really, like, she was not hurt. I would never hurt her or any other animal out there. I love animals and I would never hurt one. So I just wanted to make sure that everyone understands that. So once again, thank you very much for watching and I hope to see you guys soon. Bye for now.  Ok, so that's the diaper and that's my dog. As you can see, the diaper is not on my dog and it took her literally 15 minutes while I was in my room to take off the diaper."
