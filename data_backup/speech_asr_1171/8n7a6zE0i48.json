  "transcription": " When it comes to dynasties in the wine world, the Tienpont family is the Bordeaux dynasty to be reckoned with. And this wine is made by Luc Tienpont. This vineyard, it doesn't give much away on the label, Villa de Catrasser, so the Villa of the Four Sisters, but it says Margot, and that's the clue. This little tiny 1.5 hectare plot, so basically  a football pitch, is in Margot, right in the centre of Margot, and there are 70-year-old vines planted here. It comes from the 2009 vintage, which I'm sure you will have heard is fated as the greatest vintage of all time, and it really is that good. And the point about this wine is that it's the second wine from the estate, from the tiny estate, and it's unbelievably good value. So I picked up a bottle, had a sniff, and then grabbed as much as I could possibly carry  because the flavours are sensational. Like all 2009s, it's a tad on the young side, but some of the second wines are starting to perform pretty well and this is one of them. Margots are always more advanced than the more masculine wines from Pelliac and Saint-Julien and Saint-Esteve. And the recipe in here is about 50-50 sort of Merlot Cab, so the Merlot bit is the bit that softens this wine up. Ah, that's lovely. Touch of classy Margot fruit there.  A little bit of that sort of cigar box thing that we really like about decent left bank clarets. Now, this is the cool bit. The tannins are there. It is mouthwatering, but then you're going to have roast beef or whatever when you're drinking it. So, you know, it'll stand up to food, but they're softening a little bit. They're dusty tannins, not harsh tannins. The fruit's really, really smart. It's classic Telltale Cassis notes.  very very posh wine indeed for sort of 15 quid I think you really need to get involved. Hope that you like it. Cheers."
