  "transcription": " Noosa's surfing pioneers found a paradise that far exceeded their dreams. Five perfect point breaks stretched around an untouched headland. Reached along rainforest trails where you could fill your water bottle from mossy streams. A one-pub fishing village with a one-room surf club sitting atop a sand dune. A campground at the end of the street where you could catch a wave on one side  their fish dinner on the other. And presiding over all of this, is his oldest and grandest building, Hell's Lodge. I mean, it was 60s Australia. It was just laid back and nothing around and simple and complex. And it was heaven. And surfing national, uncrowded on eight foot days, that's about as good as it can get. But now,  It's still heaven. Noosa's changed a lot in 60 years. The two things that have not changed are the endless perfect waves, now recognised as a world surfing reserve, and the enduring grandeur of Noosa's only heritage building. I just feel like it's so relaxed here and I feel like it's like, holds like a family community.  For me, it's just being so close to the beach and the amazing national park that you have. I came here 20 years ago and started this and it's the best fun I've ever had. It's not work, it's just entertainment. And how could it not be entertainment with fabulous kids like this around? So this is just a great way to spend every day of your life.  you"
