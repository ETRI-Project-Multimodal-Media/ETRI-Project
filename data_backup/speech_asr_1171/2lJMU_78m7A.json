  "transcription": " Dale Earnhardt Jr. out front. Can he make it? White flag. Next flag ends the race. And Dale Jr. is scooting away. Uh oh. Uh oh. He's slowing isn't he? Out of gas. Out of gas. Out of gas. 150,000 people on their feet. Jr. is slowing. He's out of fuel. He's out of gas. Out of gas. Perfect. Perfect. The closer wins it. Once again,  Where did he come from? Ran out down the back straightaway, bud. You have a great race. What our plan was, and it wasn't a good car, so we knew better and we came back with a good car."
