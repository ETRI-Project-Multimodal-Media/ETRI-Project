  "transcription": " Hey, what's going on out there? Just here in my front yard. Just been practicing a little bit. Setting the setup up. I got the Jungle Hammock Snug Pack with the Cowdy Brown Bushcraft USA Tarp. I just wanted to show everyone.  I don't have the bug net up yet. But this is what I got. Just been doing a little practicing out here in the front yard. Very first YouTube video. And I just wanted to thank Mitch from Native Survival.  Really enjoy your videos. Kenneth Cram, you're great as well. And all you bushcrafters out there, really enjoy your videos. But that's it, that's the setup. Thanks for watching.  you"
