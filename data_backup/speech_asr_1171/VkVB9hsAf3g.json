What we need for that, it's best if you have some sort of heavy-based enamel dish to absorb the heat. So into this, I'm basically going to put layers. A bit of butter.  Don't mind I'm using my fingers here. I'm just going to kind of spread this out. And I've got some very thinly sized regular potato plus some sweet potato, you know, something special. So I'm just going to put in a whole layer of regular potato. Right. I've got some onion, so that's going to go in.  go there. Nice thin slices, right? And then this is some regular milk with cream. I'm going to put in a whole bunch of cream into there. And whoops, let's use this. Pour in a little bit. I'm going to use some little chili pepper here, just a little bit. So  salt and black pepper like so. And some cheese, this is gouda, no this is cheddar, we also have gouda so I'm just putting some slices on here. I'm going to put in a little bit of sweet potato, again very very thinly sliced, just a layer.  Try and get it kind of evenly spread out in the pan, right? A bit more onion. And I've got some gouda, so I'm mixing up the cheeses.  I'm gonna do this one kind of pretty because this is gonna be the top, right?  I'm gonna try and just put little pieces of butter on this, just all the way around. All right.  I'm gonna put a little bit of spice on that neck right I Think I'm actually gonna put a little more cheese on the top. So So mixing the Gouda and the cheddar  Cheese slicer is the most fantastic thing Just lay that out And then sprinkle a little nutmeg I'm gonna put it in my hand first because I don't want it to all come rushing out, right? A little nutmeg And also a little bit of paprika  And that is your scalloped potatoes. We are going to put them in the oven to cook alongside the turkey for about 45 minutes, okay?  you"
