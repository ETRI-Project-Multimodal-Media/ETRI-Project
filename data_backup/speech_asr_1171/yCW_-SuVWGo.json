  "transcription": " I'm a house of cards and hurricane  J.C. Chazet of NSYNC, who stepped in to produce one of the tracks. It was really interesting for me to be, you know, like behind the board while those guys are in there singing. I was like, oh, you sing that part? Okay, okay, that's cool, man. J.C. also gave us his take on the controversy surrounding Britney Spears, who dated fellow NSYNC-er Justin Timberlake back in the band's heyday. She's an adult at this point. I can't tell her what to do. She's doing what she wants to do. My word of advice for her was just enjoy your life. The Backstreet Boys  have seen a lot of change but one thing at least has remained the same. We've gone through so much together, trials and tribulations, it's made us who we are."
