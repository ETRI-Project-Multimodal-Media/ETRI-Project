There is only one website that you should purchase this from and that is the official Turkish government website www.evisa.gov.tr. Have a great trip!  Well, it's quite simple really. They're ripping you off. They hope that you don't notice that you're on the wrong site or they trick you into thinking that you're on the right website. This is how it works. A Turkish visa from the official website costs you just $20 and you can pay by credit or debit card on the website.  What? You're surprised!  Did you hear that right? Yes. You are paying for some unscrupulous monkey to copy what you sent them into the official Turkish visa website and apply online for your visa which they then forward to you. But instead of paying just $20 for the privilege, you end up paying $40, $50 or even up to $100 for something that should have cost you $20. Some of these websites may not even send you a visa or they might send you a fake visa. You may never hear from them again.  These websites operate outside of Turkey and they're nothing to do with the Turkish government's official website. Avoid them at all costs. They really are a scam. You can get the latest up-to-date information about Turkish e-visas and the requirements for British nationals by visiting the Foreign and Commonwealth website at www.gov.uk. Let's listen to our guy one last time.  official Turkish website at www.evisa.gov.tr Thanks for watching.  you"
