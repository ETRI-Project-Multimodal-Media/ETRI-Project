  "transcription": " Push in the past again, oh You know my little triggers keep on triggering them all I've had enough of this, oh Our timelines getting worn out when we're going back and forth You know we're only pretending  We are now at the area of the old town  I'm going to make a hole in the bottom of the box.  My heart is wasted Keep on paper chasing Active pain is falling We are growing out of love Growing out of love Growing out of love  Keep on paper chasing All these made up reasons You're the only one for me My heart is wasted We keep on paper chasing Acting pretty smart When we are growing out of love Why can't we face it? Keep on paper chasing All these made up reasons You're the only one for me My heart is wasted Keep on paper chasing  We are now at the area of the Baguio-Bua-Itogon Road  Why can't we face it? Keep on paper chasing All these made up reasons You're the only one for me My heart is wasted Keep on paper chasing Acting pretty small when we are growing out of love Growing out of love  Why can't we face it? We keep on paper chasing All these made up reasons You're the only one for me My heart is wasted We keep on paper chasing Acting pretty smart when we are growing out of love Why can't we face it? Keep on paper chasing  All these bitter reasons you're the only one for me My heart is twisted, it keep on paper chasing Acting pretty smart when we are growing out of love Growing out of love Growing out of love  You"
