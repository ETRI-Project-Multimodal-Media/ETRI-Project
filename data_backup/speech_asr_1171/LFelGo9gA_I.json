  "transcription": " Habib University by far is the most generous private university in the world and it is made possible by the community support that we have and the vision of the university.  Pakistani diaspora who can impact higher education and create new pathways to support it. At this time I think it is a great pleasure to thank the Dharani family for their great contribution. Coming together, flying all the way from Houston to participate in this occasion. Humbly, I'm going to request every single member  of the family that is here to come up on the stage so that we can thank you properly and acknowledge you. Thank you so much for providing our family this opportunity to make this humble contribution.  September 29th, 2018 is now etched in Habib University history."
