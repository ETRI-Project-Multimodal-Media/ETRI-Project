  "transcription": " At the moment we haven't received any official communication regarding the establishment of a search and rescue region by the Libyan authorities.  The rescue region does not correspond to a territorial water zone, which remains limited to 12 miles from the coastline. Therefore, in international waters it is not possible to prevent the navigation of any ship.  to more human suffering. With the reduced capacity, fewer ships in the area, it will mean more people will drown at sea. Also for those who are taken back to Libya by the Libyan Coast Guard, it means they will be kept in captivity, that they're again exposed to violence, to abuse, to maltreatment, to extortion. And this is really a grave concern that really worries us a lot."
