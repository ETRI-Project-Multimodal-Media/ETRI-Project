  "transcription": " TSS is a sensitive freight business where we specialise in medical and computer equipment and look after deliveries and customers' requirements on a day-to-day basis. You know, you're moving around medical equipment like the CT that you go through when you're laying on a CT or you might go through an MRI and that's what we move around. We've had some crazy things at times where it's very high security. We've got police escort,  It's quite stressful at times because you don't know what it is and you know, you've just got to be careful what we do, how we drive the trucks. We do a lot of stuff for the Royal Melbourne Hospital, those sort of big hospitals that we do work for, where we have dedicated vehicles that will leave from Melbourne. My background is I've had Isuzu's in the past when I've worked at other major businesses and they're just reliable, you know, they're comfortable and great vehicles to drive. So much technology in the vehicles, the way that they drive now, they're like driving cars. That's how easy it's become to drive a truck. Customers get to drive their trucks.  a bit stressed when their equipment's bouncing around the back of a vehicle so we have that air ride suspension to stop that vibration. You want to get a vehicle that's been going for a long time, it's got good records with it. We just did our service not long ago and it's locked you for another 20,000 k's. Safety's the best thing about having these vehicles."
