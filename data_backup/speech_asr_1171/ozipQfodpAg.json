  "transcription": " Good morning. It's the day of the big run and here is the plan right here. So the whole track is 400 meters and at each end there's a 200 meter mark. So I want to run the first 200 meters in 37 seconds, next one in 36 seconds, the next one in 35 seconds, and the next one in 35 seconds, and the last one in 35 seconds. For a total of 2 minutes and 58 seconds for the whole kilometer.  Alright, I just went and ran my warm up. I felt good, I did 1800 meters, give or take. And yeah, just ran the kilometer visualizing it and it feels good, feels good, legs are feeling good.  so  so  6, 7, 8, 59! 59! Bloody good work! So we're doing 4 sets of 200 meters at 31, 32 seconds each. 2 minute break.  Go!  Train hard, win easy.  you"
