  "transcription": " We want to write an equation that models exponential growth or decay and we are told that at the beginning of a population study a city had 36 or 360,000 people and that every year since the population has grown by 0.68 percent. So t is the number of years since the start of the study and y is the name of our function. So y is equal to the initial number, so  360,000 times 1 plus the rate, 1 plus 6.8 percent, to the number of years. That is again about understanding the components of the formula."
