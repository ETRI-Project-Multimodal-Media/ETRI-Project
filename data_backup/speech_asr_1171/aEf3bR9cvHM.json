  "transcription": " If it's love that you need, you can't take it from me Cause I'm the one who's giving it up And I know it's been hard, but you've been this far  Oh  Is it in the air tonight? Feel it if the time is right I know you've been waiting, baby  This morning's recap Above all things you're supposed to be prospering hope in God for biblical hope has an expectation that there is good in your future. Hope is a belief and an expectation  that God has something for me in the future. And faith says, all right, you placed that order and there's a firm expectation for that. Let me go pick up the package and I'm going to bring it to your front door because faith is a substance of things hoped for. See, when you have hope in God, you don't lose faith on what is happening in the future. You've opened the door for your faith to go and get in your hope  and bring back and take things that are in your future and bring it to your now. Thanks for watching. Join us this Wednesday for our midweek Bible study."
