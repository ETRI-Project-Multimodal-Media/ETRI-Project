  "transcription": " But dreams gotta be bigger than what they were the day before man, let's keep pushing it like I see where this can go and This is something real. You know what I mean? So let's show the world something real man. It starts here. It's not always fucking beautiful Thank y'all for tonight. This is our last song very Fucking holidays. I don't know what y'all celebrate, but love y'all  Can y'all light the sky up one more time tonight before we get out of here? Let's light this whole arena up tonight  I left for Moscow and I am 27 And at least I know I died a legend Yeah We're all in brighter light, we're together And keep the vibe alive inside forever And feel me forever  Let's wave them like this right now.  27 roaches in the ashtray, smile as if no one hated it all As if anyone understood any time I evolved You tell me, what would you do if what you drink ain't true? Buy a Bentley and look just like you? How am I supposed to write a song when I'm famous and all this pain is created? I guess I'll overdose on inspiration at 27 At 27, uh  I can't right now I'm a rolling stone  The clear way. Hands up.  So can you take me higher? Can you take me higher? And if I must go, then I am twenty-seven And at least I know I'm not a legend  27  Let this voice sing from my soul. Let's speak through this song.  I  Cleveland, thanks y'all! Goodnight!"
