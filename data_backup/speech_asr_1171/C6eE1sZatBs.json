I mean literally just yesterday I was wee-donned by a wee dog. Isn't that just lovely? Now, brace yourselves for the lovely Natalie Cassidy.  My all new workout regime is so much better than last week's I'm gonna put all the weight back on just so I can do it again Some of the moves include the Peggy Mitchell arm swings The Pat Butcher bottom bounces and my favorite the Sonia Trumpet squats But also forgetting the Phil Mitchell shoulder shrugs What?  You never guess what's happened to me. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I just got a job as an auctioneer. Oh, my God. So what we're going to do, right, is we're going to sell the Grease CD. Oh, my God. I really like it. Oh, my God. So let's start the bidding. I have £35. Oh, my God. £35. £35. What are you? Ramblin' at 50. Dingaling at 70. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. It's sold. It's a lovely Alicia Dixon. My time. Show time. Mine. Let's roll. Let's rhyme.  Scream a line of paper, gonna keep this tight. Here I go again upon the ravers rhyme. Misty with a bump and flex. And cut. Thank you, Alicia. Definitely one of my favourite sugar bibs there. Oh dear, wasn't she from the sugar bibs? Oh dear, anyway. Right, so I'm going to leave you with my final guest.
