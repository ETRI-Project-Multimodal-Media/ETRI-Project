  "transcription": " The family aspect of celebrating black history is something that runs deep in African American families, especially for those families that have migrated from the South to the North. My mother was born in Clarksdale, Mississippi, and the stories that she she told and shared with me as a child, talking about Emmett Till, talking about the Little Rock Nine,  Also sharing the literatures that she had come across, talking about a gilded six bits, something that I had never thought I would be able to grasp until I started reading Zora Neale Hurston. All of those aspects of black history were brought to me from my mother. Black history is history usually that is passed down. When you think about Africans and how they pass down history, they start stories  with the term, crick crack. And so when they start those stories, they crick crack and start a generational story that tells a tale of where they've come from, who they are, and who they aspire for their children to be. I think about some of the heroes that shaped that as well. And I think about Mary McLeod Bethune, who was very influential in President Roosevelt's cabinet and how she talked about the ability to have  African Americans involved in the process of being... what's the term? The process of being chosen to fight war for the country that they lived in. I think about Fannie Lou Hamer, who was a civil rights activist who fought for the right for people to vote. All of these people were educators, but all of them did literally what I'm doing, which is sharing  from their perspective where we are, where we need to go so that we can create change. And ultimately that was shared with me from my parents."
