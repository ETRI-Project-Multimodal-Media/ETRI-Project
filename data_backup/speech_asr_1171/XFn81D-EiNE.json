Now you can't leave your house without seeing one.  movies, eating out, locker pickup, or the 7-Eleven, or even checking in for your doctor's visit, kiosks are everywhere. I expect to see this expansion continue as smaller companies start to realize the financial benefits kiosk automation provides. One of the biggest trends over the past couple of years has been the desire for smaller, sleeker kiosk designs. The prevalence and expansion of kiosk programs, and more importantly, specialization of kiosks, has necessitated kiosk companies offer smaller sizes to accommodate a wide variety of physical spaces and budgets.  and the number of visits. Don't confuse this with a shift to smaller kiosks. As the industry continues to grow and specialize, I expect to see a wide variety of different sizes that will be driven primarily by the application. Bigger ones like parking tickets and smaller ones for simpler transactions like eating out. As a consequence of this growth, I'm already seeing a heightened focus on security for kiosks, whether that's physical security for the devices inside, the software itself, or the data being transmitted.  Considering the press coverage from the last few months revealing a large amount of bacteria on the McDonald's kiosk touchscreens, people now have an increased awareness of screen disinfecting and cleanliness. We've already seen development in kiosk touchscreens and sanitation solutions, and that trend will definitely continue to grow. Consumers are demanding organizations operate ethically, with their data safety and overall health in mind. That's why I predict these trends will continue to guide the self-service industry in 2020.  you"
