And this, we've had a lot of rain so  There's something coming up here, but I don't know what it is and this is oregano and these are beans, wax beans and green beans and Swiss chard and then here we go with our tomatoes. This is a panning of all the tomatoes. It was like 60 or 70 plants. And they're coming along. Here's some baby ones growing.  And then we have a couple of them that didn't make it so much but they're growing. And then these are going to be zucchini and melons and then the big one in the middle is watermelon. And this is lettuce, different kinds of lettuce and cabbage. And this is parsley. And then we have the potatoes.  These have white flowers and then these at the end have purple flowers. All of these are Israeli seeds, most of them, and it's all organic. It's 30 by 80 feet. See ya!  you"
