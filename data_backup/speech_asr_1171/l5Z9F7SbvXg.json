I know it shouldn't take little Vicky to tell you that, it came out the day after Papa Squatmas, my birthday. Surprise! Most people enjoy what I have to say.  I enjoy what I have to say.  Honey, I'm home What'd you do today? Oh? Today I bought Bobby some of that sour patch cereal You whore I knew I'd have a reason to divorce you See if you enjoy the cereal you're a lost cause I don't know any other way of putting it don't look for help  You won't receive it. We seek to preserve the rational. We can't risk them being compromised. You made your choice. You just had to have the cereal. So I actually haven't tried any of this cereal, but I'm sure it's bad so I was already gonna tell you guys about it.  Get out of here with your self-conscious looking fucking ass.  Look, all the cereals on the side look like they taste better than what's on the box."
