I mean here this is okay and this one really probably should have been taken out a while ago I believe these were planted at the beginning of February so we're looking at about five months  It's hard to tell because most of them were killed off by snails and I replanted some in April and I got it mixed up exactly which were which. We already took out one that was the earliest one from this spot but then it was time again to take some for dinner. So here we go. They grew really well but like I said you have to  Also watch out for whitefly, which you can actually see here. They can tear into it. Although I really haven't had any trouble with these because the plants were already pretty strong. I started them in a greenhouse, although that could also be part of the problem because they were basically too warm.  And then I moved them outside and they did much better with cooler temperatures. Again, the typical northern Germany weather is playing up. Probably going to get rained on. But yeah, after four to five months you get a nice kohlrabi. They really taste good. And the best part, fresh from the garden.  you"
