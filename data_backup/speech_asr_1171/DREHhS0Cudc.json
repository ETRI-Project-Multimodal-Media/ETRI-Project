  "transcription": " You've probably tried to or seen someone roll something like this. This is your average standard joint. I'm going to show you how to do something much simpler and much better. Here's what you'll need. You'll need cannabis, a grinder, a piece of paper, a pen,  and a cone.  to be solid. You want to leave room for airflow but you don't want your pre-rolled cone to start falling towards the end. So you just want to keep stuffing that cone. Occasionally while you're doing it I find it's helpful to reset your cannabis and center it up again. After that you're just going to continue stuffing until you have filled the joint and then you're going to grab your pen. You're going to fold down the edges. Start with one  side, then go the next bit closer, and then the final bit so that you get a nice clean end. Put any remaining cannabis back in your grinder for next time and you're good to go.  is it will boat or it will run down the side where one side burns real long and then you have to start trying to adjust it with your lighter and it's a whole thing.  Go ahead."
