Created by Ford, the ST Octane Academy is a performance driving school for owners of the Focus and Fiesta ST hot hatches.  The best part about it? The school is included in the price of the new car. All you have to do is get here.  degree whip arounds, reverse J-turns, and sliding into a parking box. Following those stunts, we hit the east course of Miller Motorsports Park for some hot laps. My instructors walked me around the track to show specific braking, entry, and exit points, and then we hopped in the car where I was told to brake later, ease onto the throttle, and most importantly, keep my eyes focused on where I want the car to go. When I was set, the instructors hopped out, and I had free reign of the track.  Our last exercise of the day was the urban cross, where the skills I learned in the morning will be put to work in an autocross scenario. Slaloms, 180 degree turns, figure 8s, and that parking box were all used here.  and my runs were timed, so they had to be good. Long story short, it was super fun, and when the times were tallied, turns out I came in second place.  so  I love hot hatches, and the Focus and Fiesta ST are two of my favorites. Thanks to Ford's ST Octane Academy, I get to spend a full day on the track with these two cars and experience their full potential. For owners, the Octane Academy is a no-brainer.
