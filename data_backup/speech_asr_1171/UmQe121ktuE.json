  "transcription": " We looked at everything that the women said was a pain point for them and we turned it into a design feature to get rid of that pain point. So everything is super soft, like our bras were referred to as a hug and a bra. They love it because the design is pretty. We've made it totally seamless, wire free. We have a jewel adjustment at the side here and in the center so that's to allow for  when they're very swollen after surgery and for the swelling to go down. I decided to use bamboo as a material. It sounded like a wonder material, much better than cotton, much better than most synthetic fibers. We did a clinical study in UCD and as part of that, the biomedical engineers in UCD tested our fabric, our bamboo fabric mix against 100% cotton and also against one of our competitor products. So we have scientific proof that our material is highly antibacterial.  And our bamboo material is 60% more absorbent than cotton. It really just makes me very excited to see the impact that we're having on normal women's lives and helping them get back on track and recover faster.  you"
