  "transcription": " This wild chimpanzee is using a brand new tool. A brush tip probe that's better at gathering up termites for a snack. Oh and also, these chimps invented it. The discovery is part of a growing body of evidence that shows that it's not just us humans who are constantly tweaking and improving our own technology. Researchers watching termite nests in the Republic of Congo recorded the footage. And while chimpanzee populations elsewhere are known  to use regular sticks for the same job, according to researchers, this new tool does a much better job by giving the termites more to grab onto. So if you're interested in making one of your own, here's how. First, uproot a plant with your hands, or use your teeth to clip the stem at its base. Then, turn the end into a brush tip by pulling the stem through your teeth. This splits the probe lengthwise. Now separate the stem's fibers by biting and pulling them apart. And finally, take your tool to the nearest termite mound, dip it in, and pull out a tasty  treat. Scientists are hoping more research will determine exactly how this particular group of chimps came up with the more advanced tool and if its use is unique to this location. For Discovery News, I'm Jorge Ribas."
