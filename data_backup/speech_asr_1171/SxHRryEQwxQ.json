Let's get inside find out about them. Bon Appetit. Let's go. Oh, yeah  Hey guys I'm here at the snack bar, a subscriber told me to get this, it's mince cheese, it's got chicken in it apparently and it's really spicy, some sweet and sour sauce. I'm at the snack bar here in Utrecht, it says get involved! Battered snack bar snack, chicken inside, I break it in half.  Oh, it's hot. See like little bits of chicken meat. Smells of oil. Oh, that's spicy. I wasn't expecting that. It's hot. It's good. It's nice though.  I like that. It's pretty good. This is the dude who served it to me. Yeah, pretty nice. Chilies in them. Dip it in the sweet and sour. Not sweet and sour. Sweet like spicy sauce.  That goes well together. It's really nice. You may not get very many and you've got six for 3.50 including the sauces, 50 cents, but they're tasty. Nice snack. I like it.  Nice weather here, this is the centre of Centrum. I don't know what sort of cuisine it is, might be Indo, maybe it's Dutch, I don't know but it goes very well, the chillies.  Great, good with a drink I reckon.  review in the future. Oh yeah!"
