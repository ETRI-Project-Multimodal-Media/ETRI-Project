  "transcription": " The X-Press Archer is a great bow press that's perfect for anyone regardless of whether you're a shop owner that works on bows every day or an at-home bow mechanic that just does it every now and then because this press is economically priced but packed full of some amazing features.  The first being the new quick spin wheels. These wheels allow you to quickly adjust for any width or type of limb, regardless of whether you have a compound bow or a crossbow. The spacing allows you to move clear of any type of cam system or axle system as well. And from there, the new safety lock riser shelf or riser pad allows you to press firmly down and secure your bow  to the press and then give you both hands to make other adjustments as needed. The new jack has a faster speed, but also it has a new handle that allows you a lot more leverage for easier cranking. And from there, the press is fully numbered with digits all across it in every movable position so that you can have quick references to make sure that you're set up perfectly for the bow that you're working on. If you're looking for a great new press  the right price, check out the Express Archer."
