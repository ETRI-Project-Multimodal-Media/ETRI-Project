  "transcription": " Hi everyone, this is Dr. Lusanda Shimage Matsuse from My First Gynae and today we're at the SAPC studio. We're going to be on a show called Health Talk and we're talking about the female and bleeding. Enjoy.  so  so  How was it, Doctor? It was hot in the studio. But I mean, I think the message got out there and I really hope whoever's watching will leave the  Television seats wiser and more knowledgeable and that's what it's about just getting the message out there. It's a conversation and nothing is all blimmin  Thank you for that very interesting question and I would want to ask that 26 year old a few other questions as well as to Does she suffer with acne does she have abnormal hair growth in other words that she have a beard does she have hair between her breasts on her back and so forth and Basically what I'm alluding to is could this person have what we call PCOS  Don't be scared to go to your gynae  visitor gynae doesn't mean you're going to get bad news. I would rather you know what's wrong than you have these unanswered questions lingering. This is Dr. Lusanda Shimange Matsuse from My First Gynae. Stop. Stop. Start. Stop.  You"
