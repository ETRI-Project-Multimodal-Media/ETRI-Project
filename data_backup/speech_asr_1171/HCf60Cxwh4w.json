  "transcription": " My name's Sam Tom with a Summit Street Survey. The East Yorkshire city of Hull has suffered greatly during the current economic recession. But people stayed loyal to the St Stephen's shopping centre during the darkest years of 2008 to 2012, during which time footfall increased 30% and every retail unit is occupied. So in today's Summit Street Survey I'm asking, what's best?  Shopping online  Amazon or like any other shopping online place and just order it straight away. I think it's going to change and I think online is probably going to be the future unfortunately. I think it could replace it. I hope it doesn't. Certainly the stores that I use are a lot easier to shop online than they are to come into the store. Have you just come out this evening shopping? Yes I have because my bus is late that's all."
