Do your part and choose products made with the least amount of packaging, or at least with packaging that's recyclable. One of the best ways to reduce the amount of packaging trash is to avoid individually wrapped items like snack packs and single  Instead, buy in bulk and create your own single-size servings using containers that can be reused over and over again. And when shopping for produce, choose loose fruits and vegetables. This move will actually save you money because the prepackaged ones are usually more expensive. And remember to save and reuse your produce bags from a previous trip. That way your purchase will have zero waste. It's also smart to look for items like dish soap and laundry detergents in concentrated formulas.  The container size is often smaller, meaning it requires less energy to produce and transport. And don't forget to look for items that come in recyclable materials. For example, a jug of milk is almost always easier to recycle than a wax-coated carton. Tuna cans are easier to recycle than tuna in foiled containers. And remember, aluminum glass and steel packaging are always the best choice because they can be recycled over and over again without the loss of any quality. Packaging makes up about a third of the waste that we generate.  Do your part and when choosing between two similar products, choose the one with the least amount of packaging."
