And the CEO says if the public doesn't want it, they'll drop the idea. Environmentalists say it's unworkable. Environmentally, very low impact. There's the inevitable environmental damage the massive dredging would cause to the detriment of other well-established industries like boating, surfing and diving. The amount of dredging that would be required in order to get those boats in there is massive.  We are talking millions and millions of dollars every year. It's such a jewel geographically. The ongoing dredging that would be required to maintain the turning circle would probably outweigh a lot of the benefit. He's a good diver, so that's fantastic. But I'd take my advice from retired ship captains and the cruise ship organisation. So all this bit that, oh, where's the birds going to go?  on the land, well, if it wasn't for man, the birds wouldn't be there. That's more or less the Mayor's message to the 450 species of marine life that have taken up residence in the Gold Coast Seaway, carved through the Spit in 1986. But we also should remember and point out that the whole Spit of it is man-made. It's not like it's an environment that was nature-made. It was man-made years ago. The Mayor is wrong about the whole Spit being man-made.  It's existed for centuries, but it was altered in the 80s to provide a safe ocean entrance for boats. I weigh up this way. Some seagrass versus more jobs for the Gold Coast.  so  so  so  so  so  you  We know in the end this is a way for private entrepreneurs to get access to Crown land, public park land for private commercial use. It's a land grab again.  you"
