I could hear something crashing you know. Coming through the trees. I watched up here I could see a cow. She came up in this little clearing up here. There was about 4 or 5 little cows right there. She came as close as 20 yards. Exactly 20 yards and drilled her. Good job dude. She took off up this way and went, I think she circled back around here.  and I heard crash on the pier. We're going to give her a few minutes. Yeah, for sure. Good job. We're going to go with the OCD. That was a pretty good shot. She's not going to go very far. I shot right up through that climbing on my knees. Well, it's been about 45 minutes. We're going to go and see where she went. Yeah. She was standing just about right here. I'm trying to find some blood.  Alright, we're coming up and we just spotted our first piece of blood right here on this tree. So that's a good sign we got her. Following along, up on this log. Well, she turned and she's going side hill now, so if she's not going uphill, that's a good sign. Got the ribbon on the last big log spot.  Watch, she should be right in here. I did. She's right here. Nice. That's done. Yep. She's gonna be fun to get out of there. I know, she's in a bad spot. There's your arrow. Stick it out of her? Yep.  Good job, dude That is so cool Opening day, Steven called her in with the calf call and Got her first shot dropped her within 20 yards Pretty awesome She's a pretty mature cow She's a nice size, not as big as my cow last year but  She's a definitely mature, good looking animal. Pretty good afternoon though, I think. Yep, got packs all loaded down, got the elk taken care of, got all the good meat off her and the ivories and gonna take off and get back to camp.  you"
