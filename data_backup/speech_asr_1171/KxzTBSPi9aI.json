  "transcription": " Missing Someone  Good morning! Welcome back to my channel you guys. It is 6.15 in the morning. I hate waking up early. Oh no. It is the first day of my senior year. Can I have mixed emotions?  I'm gonna do  I just feel like I can't do my own makeup with foundation. I just feel not right. So, this is what I do. And it looks kind of terrifying. But, you know.  Powder  But I know nobody wants creases. Now for my favorite part.  I'm running short on time here. I still gotta eat. Do my mascara.  This is the reality, okay?  I'm gonna put that on  I just got done switching my schedule around because my counselor didn't give me a math class so I had to get that fixed. And now I have to go to my second school. Because you know me, education is everything. And, um, yeah. Now I'm gonna get into my scrubs. My mirror is dirty, uh, sorry about that. Yep, in my scrubs. Yay, what's next? The only school I actually like. I'm running a little late because I had to change my schedule. Oh, look at how cute my scrunchie is.  I don't know if you can see, but... Hello? It's like a little boat, it's so cute. Okay, anyways, um... Yeah, when I close out this video, I might have a different hair color, so... Surprise at the end! Stay... Stay till the very end, please. Okay guys, if you have been around on my channel since like last year, you know this is my WestMac Spessy. She's been in a few of my videos. She was in my WestMac tour video, school tour or whatever, and then...  Valentine's Day Vlog! Yeah, we were jamming out. So, we're back again. Stronger, better. 2 weeks, 2nd year. No you don't. Anyways, we're gonna go do some animal stuff.  I hope you enjoyed this video. It's honestly a very realistic first day of school. I was panicking, I was a mess, I was running late. Senior year, gonna be a good one, hope so. If you enjoyed the video, give it a big thumbs up, comment down below. If the comments aren't disabled, I hope they're not, but whatever.
