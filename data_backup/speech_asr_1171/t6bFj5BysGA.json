  "transcription": " The camera is kept stable using this advanced electronic gimbal. It has three motors controlling different directions ensuring that the camera stays flat no matter which direction it's moving in.  It also has lock points built in so you can secure it before storage or transportation. All of the motors should be unlocked before powering on the Osmo. The Osmo features an ergonomic handle with intuitively placed buttons and controls. The handle itself is made from a high-grade polymer with a rubber grip designed for a secure, rugged handhold.  When you hold the Osmo, all of the buttons are immediately accessible. This includes the power switch, the system status LED, the camera status LED, the camera shutter button, the record button, and the joystick. On the front, conveniently placed under your index finger, is the trigger. Above that is the external microphone input port.  The mobile device holder or other accessories can be attached to the left side of the handle. To charge or swap the Intelligent Battery, you will need to open the battery compartment like this, remove the battery, and put it in its charger. When fully charged, the indicator light on the charger will turn green. In the next segment, we will look at how you set up the Osmo before using it for the first time. Thanks for watching.  you"
