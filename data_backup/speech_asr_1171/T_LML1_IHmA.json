We get along really well. I shot with Stephanie again today and the awesome crew and the clothes were really cool.  Now we're just starting off with something kind of long and loosely wavy. I've just blown out her hair with a little bit of volume spray to get a little bit of a nice body. Hi, my name is Kim Baker, and today we're at the Mac and Jack shoot. And I'm working with model Stephanie. These are her natural color lips. I'm just adding a little bit of a mauve-y color just to kind of pop it up. So the look is very clean and fresh. And that's our look at the Mac and Jack shoot.  Had a lot of great clothes that are really great for winter like New Year's and parties and holiday stuff. Lots of glittery stuff but also really warm and cute sweaters. They're really casual and comfy. It was a lot of fun.  Since the last Math & Drag shoot, my career has been going really well. I've been coming back for Fashion Week, which was really busy and really tiring, but I think it's worth it. I just got here from Greece like four days ago, five days ago, but when I got here I got crazy right away. They were in the candy shop. Sugar Rush. Sugar Rush. What's the name of the hyperglycemia?  There was an ad in the September issue of Cosmo from the last Mackinac campaign shoot. My mom singing and my grandma made them happy so that made me happy. And I found the ad and it's double pages and like it was awesome. I was so excited.  In the next couple of months, keep tuned to the MackinJack Twitter, Facebook, Instagram. It will give you an inside look at what's going on in the fashion world through MackinJack.  you"
