This is the first time we've had such a sampling where we've invited bloggers from New Delhi  to come and taste our menu because we are extremely proud of our food. Air Asia has invited me to this event to taste their elaborate menu on board. First time an airline has organized a food review. The food display and the presentability of the food and the taste to top it all is phenomenal. I couldn't believe that they had gone through the entire cooking process that airline food normally goes through.  It seems my entire life goes around food which is why I am here. In the lines of cuisine, they are doing something with the oriental menus, they are doing something with the Indian menus and they are doing something with the continental menus too. I have tried various dishes which Air Asia serves in its airline. One of my favourite was veg enchilada served with lovely mushroom sauce.  which I have tasted on board. It's been a really pleasant experience. Especially the Andhra chicken. They have the gems from the South Indian cuisine. The menu is designed very well. There are multiple options in breakfast, lunch, mealtimes, which can be pre-booked or bought on board. They have a plethora of options for food. Whether you want to go the healthier route with sprout salad or whether you want to indulge in something like parathas, they will serve you the best.  the way Ayresia goes.  I would recommend though in order for you as a flyer to actually get the best of this menu, pre-booking is the way to go and the only way you can pre-book is on AirAsia.com. So not only book your flight tickets on AirAsia.com but at the same time book your meals on AirAsia.com. What this does for you is it's a matter of substantial savings. So go ahead and use AirAsia.com."
