First thing after a long day of fishing you're going to be tired and what not. Just take your time filleting them and make sure you get as much meat off as you can. You owe it to the fish since you took them. Alright, so I'm going to get started here in just a minute.  I'm going to go ahead and get the bolts.  So  So that was the first one.  That was my tip this week on how to fillet fish. That's the way that I prefer to fillet my fish. One of the other things to keep in mind is, most importantly, make sure you got a sharp knife. Keep that sharpener there. Use it, especially on certain fish that have big bones. And another thing to keep in mind, how do you plan on preparing your fish? How do you plan on cooking it? Some fish want it like it's staked. Some fish, smoked, skin on, skin off. Just different things to think about when you go and do your filleting of your fish.  This has been your tip of the week, sponsored by Custom Rods, Seaschool, Big Daddy Sports Fishing, Pirate Johnnies, Sunset, and the CCA. We'll see you next time."
