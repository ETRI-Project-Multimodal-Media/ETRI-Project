  "transcription": " Greetings, Spy Hounds! We're on Chicken Island near the Chicken Coop. So we have to be super sneaky and not get caught. To sharpen your Spy Skills, here's a little test for you. Can you find Chet? Well, he might be here. Or here. Wow, that Invisi-Shield is amazing! Chet? Chet?  You're wasting a battery! Thank you! Ahem. Okay, Spy Hounds. We need to get inside the chicken coop. Now, unfortunately, right now, we are outside the chicken coop. Even more unfortunately, the chicken coop is guarded by lasers, electrified trip wires, and pumpkin pies on catapults. Yes, the old pumpkin pie catapult. Delicious, yet dangerous. Okay, Spy Hounds, you're doing a great job, so let's keep going.  You'll need to help me figure out how to get into this chicken coop, snatch back the poodle diamond from Spot Spotnik, and make Charlene happy again. And we'll get started immediately. Uh, after my nap."
