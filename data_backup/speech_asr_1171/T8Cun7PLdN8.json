  "transcription": " Remittances are very important because of their size. Remittances are at the moment some $325 billion to developing countries. That is three times as large as official development aid. It is almost as large as all the foreign direct investment together.  A very important advantage of remittances is that it goes directly to households and often the households that needed it most. And that means that suddenly families have surplus money that they can use for education of their kids. They have surplus money to invest in small businesses. They can also open banking accounts now because they have foreign money.  The government is trying to stop the flow of water from the river."
