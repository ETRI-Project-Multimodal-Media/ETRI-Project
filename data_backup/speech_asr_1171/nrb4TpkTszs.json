  "transcription": " I am David Sampson AKA Diz And this is The Force Always  the  So let's get right into VIEWS. VIEWS this time around is about Jon Favreau's live action TV series that's yet to really sort of claim a lot of reasoning behind it at the moment or any photos, ideas. All we know is that it's going to be set after Return of the Jedi. Now there's been a lot of talk that it should be about Mandalorians.  Mandalorians are the guys like Boba Fett or Django Fett, depends on what generation you're from. But I think it's a good idea. I think it should be a bit more about the gangster world in general. Pirates, the Hutts, bounty hunters, Mandalorians, it should be generalised storytelling. That's my idea for the genre.  on  my  and  I give it 7 out of 10. I wouldn't say I'm super excited, I'm just curious to know what direction it's going to go in, what details it will give us. That's it so far. So I wouldn't say it's a great trailer, but I'd say it's a good trailer. Anyway, so 7 out of 10 for that. That's my reviews. Let's get into interviews. Interviews is 2Q, that's right, 2Q. That's 2 questions I'll ask myself for you guys out there. First question is, what does Resistance need to do  do  the  is  that I think that it needs to be adult, it needs to be gritty, it needs to be cinematic for TV, it needs to be amazing, full stop. It needs to have an adult feel. When I say that, not like swear words, nudity, things like this, just a real story grittiness to it. I think that there would just suit the show very well. It can't be clean, nicely done,  the  to  always  next time as I say from the force always keep rocking  you"
