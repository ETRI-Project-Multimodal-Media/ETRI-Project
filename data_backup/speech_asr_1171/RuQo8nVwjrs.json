  "transcription": " We went down to Cherry Creek and picked up some samples of the water. And we got those samples and looked at them through a microscope. And in the picture, I'm fascinated by the discovery  I found because we found a little small creature which looked like a larvae of a dragonfly. But once you looked under it through the microscope, you could see all the details in its eyes, body, legs. You could see the whole thing. It tells me that there's a lot of things out there that you still need to discover and the world is full of more creatures like that, that I am willing to take that leap and try to make new discoveries.  and we had like fluorescent powder on our hands and my nails were glowing. This relates to forensic science because law enforcement uses it to look at crimes. I learned that I can be a microbiologist. In the picture that you see, what we're doing is we're working on bacteria and we created art out of it. And I decided to draw the Deathly Hallows using bacteria. The way scientists use this  is when they're trying to study bacteria and if it can be useful or harmful to the human body or it doesn't do anything at all to the human body, they occasionally use UV lights just to see it or they use microscopes. What I learned was that science just doesn't focus on one topic. There are so many topics that you can choose from. I learned that in science it's not all hard, difficult,  and frustrating for you to do. It can be fun if you really put your mind to it. The stuff we learn here at Metro State University Denver is going to contribute to my future because I want to be an aerospace engineer and I learned different sciences and math that could help me become that. And I also learned electrical engineering here while I was in my visit and I was happy  having so much fun and how I could use that in what I want to profess in."
