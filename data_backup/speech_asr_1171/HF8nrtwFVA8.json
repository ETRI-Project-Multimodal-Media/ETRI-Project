  "transcription": " I went flying over and down, landed in a sitting position like this, and broke my back. I knew I was going to use a wheelchair for the rest of my life. Well, our feet quickly became numb. We were in the hospital several months.  before our limbs were amputated. I didn't want anyone to make a judgment about me before they saw what I could do, so I didn't want anyone to know I was an amputee. I've won the US trials. I'm going to represent my country. The doctor gets on the phone and basically says, if you'd like to see your son again, you should probably get on a plane right away. I don't know if he'll be alive by the end of the day. I prayed for one thing in particular when I was little. I prayed very, very hard that my leg would grow back.  hugging each other to stay warm. We just reasoned the sooner we die the better.  I lost a leg and a lung to cancer before I was 19 years old. On this show, I'm going to tell the story of these brave, determined people fighting back. And then I'm going to do their sport with them. Who says I can't? What I used to build myself back up was sports.  He's a fantastic person to tell these stories. Who Says I Can't is about people who won't accept limitations. It's about perseverance, courage, and heart. It's about who says I can't."
