  "transcription": " We obviously had three years of lectures with a different module each year. The first one was introduction to radio. Little bits of editing and a little bit of an intro to how radio works. We've done radio production and now radio packaging. You know, present your own show, do your own thing, have your idea. And it's been a lot of fun.  I'm a big part of Chem FM, so Chem FM is a student radio station that ARU and Cambridge University have together.  I was pretty anxious because of my accent and because I'm not like a native English speaker, but then I don't know, I just got like more and more confident. When you are on air and you're live and you're presenting, that's a completely different experience. Like you can learn the basics in class, but when you're there and you're doing your own show, that's a completely different thing. So it is just like much better and you experience radio a lot more. I would like to have it as career. I would like to continue and see where it goes. I think if I haven't done  then I wouldn't have all the experience I have now.  go out there and do it, I promise you someone's going to say yes. Get involved, I think if you want to have a radio career or any sort of broadcast media, get involved. There is so many opportunities in universities that can help you and it just helps your CV and I think get involved with student radio and write for a newspaper or do whatever you want but get involved, I think that's the main thing.  you"
