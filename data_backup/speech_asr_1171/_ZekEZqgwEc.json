  "transcription": " My name is Jorge Narvaez. I'm a police officer with Princeton, New Jersey, from Atlanta, California.  25 years now and I also a former member of the New Jersey Air National Guard 108th Security Forces Squadron. I retired from the military about in April 2018, almost a year ago. The ladder truck from Hamilton is actually being taken to Maguaro for space today to be turned over to them. It will fly out on Friday to Nicaragua and the official handover to the fire department is going to be on Sunday morning. Approximate value of about $170,000  and equipment. I'm happy that this is finally coming to an end. I'm getting almost a year for this. I'm grateful for the support that I received from many, many people, the military, the state department, the Colorado Fire Department, and Hamilton Bridge and Fire Department. It's been a joy and effort. I'm very happy that it's coming to fruition.  Oh man."
