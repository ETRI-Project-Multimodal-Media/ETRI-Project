In this demonstration on using iMovie 09, I'm going to explain to you on taking audio out of a video clip by detaching it, or generally getting rid of it and then also adding soundtracks on top such as music and things. What we've done so far is  this  of  which you might want to do for your edit. But if not, you just want to click them, delete that one, click and delete that one, and voila, the audio's gone. The easiest way is just to do this way which I told you is to audio and turn it right down. That's getting rid of audio. Now say you want to add a bit of music on top of this track. All you do is go over to here and click the little music button. And now you can browse music from all of your library. But say you  you  If it's in the background you can't move it around it just goes to the clip But this isn't the song I want so I'm just gonna put I don't know this song in there And there you go you have the soundtrack on top"
