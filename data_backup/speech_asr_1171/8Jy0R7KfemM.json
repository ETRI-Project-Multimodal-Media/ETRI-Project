  "transcription": " I'm running for alderman for the only reason anyone should. I want to help people. If you would have told me 20 years ago I'd be here doing this, I wouldn't believe you. The son of Mexican immigrants, born and raised in the hood, a high school dropout, a young father. I could have stopped there, but I didn't.  Graduated, supported my family, put myself through law school. I've dedicated my whole life to helping our communities. Worked to stop violence on our blocks, provided direct services at the Alderman's office, made safe spaces for survivors of domestic violence. Over 15 years of fighting, now here I am fighting again. Fighting a candidate from an old machine and one from a new one. But that's okay. I ain't scared of fighting.  And the people of this ward deserve someone who's going to have their back. Someone who's really going to work for them. Not for money or power, but to help. Because what else are we here for? I'm Jaime Guzman for the 14th Ward."
