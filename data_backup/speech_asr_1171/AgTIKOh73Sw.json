And this is a find I just made. It's a gold-plated bee-propelled  It's a pre-prepared Boy Scout pin. It still has the pin on the back. It's nice and shiny. It looks like it's just gold plated because there's some silver underneath the gold. Still a really cool find. Earlier, a little bit earlier, I found this buckle out here in the woods too. It's pretty cool.  when I find something else. Oh yeah, today's my first hunt using my brand new SCF coil, the 8x6 butterfly. Real quiet, I'm liking it a lot. Let you know when I find something else. Hey guys, my next target, I just found another one of these, be prepared boy scout badges, or little pins. It's cool, there's the one I just found. Here's the one I found before.  Cool. Hey everybody. I just got another target. This is a nickel target. I can see the edge right there. I don't know what it is. It looks to be a nickel.  That's a buffalo. Oh cool, I'll wash it up later and try to get a date. Well everyone, I just got my first Wheatie of the day. That's a 1930. So cool. Hopefully I can find something older.  Let you know when I do. Hey guys, here's my next find. I believe, I'm not positive, I've never actually seen one, but I think it's a musket ball. It's round, it's not perfectly round, it's a little bent out of shape, a little smashed out of shape. But out here in the woods. So cool, if this is in fact a musket ball, this is a first for me. Cool?  Hopefully I can find more.  you"
