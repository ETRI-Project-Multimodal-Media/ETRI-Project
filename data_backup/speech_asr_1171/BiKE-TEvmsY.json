  "transcription": " I take it you're Catholics, but you're the only female standing here.  It was fun being able to take a role and put my own personal spin on it and just have fun and change it up and just play a fun character. No, I came my freshman year.  requires a very good actor. So is this your first time with the board? No, I was here last year. We've got a lot of repeats, ladies and gentlemen. So we got a lot of talent coming here tonight. Tell me a little bit about what you thought about the role. It is a fun role. All right, everybody enjoy yourself tonight.  Here we go."
