  "transcription": " Jay, tell me, what is Next Generation Security? Next Generation Security is solving tomorrow's security problems. Today's antivirus and solutions, you know, talk about and protect against yesterday's news. Next Generation is focused on what's next and what's coming down the pipe so we can prevent it before it becomes a problem for you and for your customers. So tell me a little bit more about that. Why do MSPs and VARs  and their customers need next-generation security these days? Well, the technology we have today with antiviruses is almost 25 years old, doing signature-based content. Gartner stopped tracking AV companies back in 2006, and that's because they're not as effective as they used to be. Today's next-generation solutions are like what we offer. They'll help solve tomorrow's problems, and they do it in ways that allow you to have visibility and insight into what's going on in a way you've never had before.  So last question, why should people who are doing next generation security do it with Carver? We are the US based distribution for Sentinel-1. We are the go-to choice for MSPs and solution providers to provide that next generation solution in a way that you're accustomed to acquiring software like Antivirus Solutions on a monthly basis. Our team provides the expert insight you need to help protect your customers.  Thank you very much."
