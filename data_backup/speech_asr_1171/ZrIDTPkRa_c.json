In 2008, Miley apologized for taking part in a shoot with Vanity Fair, where she was pictured wearing nothing but a bed sheet.  I never intended for any of this to happen, and I apologize to my fans, who I care so deeply about.  Hitting Twitter, Miley shared a photo of the NY Post headline, alongside the caption, I'm not sorry f**k you. Number 10 years ago. Inevitably, fans flocked to the post in their thousands, impatient to have their say on the controversial images.  And a third chimed, The human body is over-sexualized period.  Climate, weather, notwithstanding, everyone should be naked as often as possible. However, many people were not happy. One ranted, I'm pretty sure she had no clothes on. This is seductive, if it's not is it ok for me to do it? Not at all I'd probably end up in jail.  But its ok since they are famous right? Famous people get away with almost everything. And another bemoaned, Miley trying to be controversial and make headlines and tired. Your team knew what you were doing and.  She said, I'm sorry that my portrait of Miley has been misinterpreted.  Miley and I looked at fashion photographs together, and we discussed the picture in that context before we shot it. The photograph is a simple, classic portrait, shot with very little makeup, and I think it is very beautiful.  The eye-watering NSFW images saw Miley posing topless with a strap on, with trousers so low her pubic hair was on show, and one completely naked with nipples on show.  Clearly not a lot has changed."
