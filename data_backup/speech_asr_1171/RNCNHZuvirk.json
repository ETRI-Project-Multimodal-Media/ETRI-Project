It's real now Alright we warmed up  Time for you to get a clip. First clip of the day. I didn't even warm up but... I'm sure we don't need the first day.  There we go.  First trick of the day.  or clips, what about you? Four. We got one for him, one for me. All right, let's keep it going.  Let me show you guys how slippery this park is. I'm gonna slide over there.  so  I told you guys, slipperiest skatepark ever. He said, slipperiest skatepark ever. I'll do it again. And he's gonna do it again.  We're out here in the wilderness. A wild angel. There he is. There he is. He's coming my way. Gotta be very careful with this. This type of savage. Here he comes. Coming in for the double peg. And... Didn't stick it. Savage out there in the woods.  Alright Matt, how many clips do you want to get? Me and Angel have 5 and 4, so how many do you want? I guess 4? 3? You want to do 3? I guess. Let's go, right now, no warm up. I guess on that curved ledge people switch 180 out. Oh, ok.  Oh I was about to say. You guys see how slippery that is? Look it. That's his footprint right there. I just missed the fall but he slid down the ramp. Oh man. Alright Matt get it. The only reason that counts is because it's slippery out here. And that was second try so.  Two more clips for Matt.  What? Dive in the ball. That was pretty sick.  That was scary. Alright we're leaving the skatepark now. Thank you guys for watching. See you on the next video."
