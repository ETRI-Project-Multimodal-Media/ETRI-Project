  "transcription": " Hi guys, Team Grenades Jamie Alderton here and today I'm taking you through a back superset workout. What we're going to do is we're going to do three different exercises, eight repetitions each exercise and then we're going to have a 30 second rest and we're going to do that for three sets. Start off, eight repetitions of a pull up. Then you go straight into eight repetitions.  on a lat pull down. Once you finish all your repetitions, we're going to come back on the pull up bar and we're just going to stretch off the back muscles for 20 seconds. Now have a 30 seconds rest and we're going to hit another set. We're going to do that for 3 sets. Let's go.  Ready to lat pulldown.  Okay, and we're just gonna hang tough for 20 seconds. This really stretches off all that muscle. If you're finding it hard to hang tough for 20 seconds, you can always put it down to the floor.  Ok, so we're going to have a 30 second rest now. We're going to hit that for another 2 sets.  on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. Thanks a lot guys, I'll see you soon."
