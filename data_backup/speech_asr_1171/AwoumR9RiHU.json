Have you ever, or maybe you still do this now, as you're discussing a price of treatment to the patient, do you ever find yourself reducing the price of the treatment in your head? So in other words, the price of the treatment is £500,  but by the time it comes out of your mouth it's £4.50. In other words £50 somewhere has gone missing. Do you ever find yourself actually doing that? When I ask dentists this, virtually every single one has admitted that sometime in their life they've actually done that or still do that on a regular basis. So why? Why do dentists reduce the price of their treatment in their heads? Well there could be two or three reasons. The first one is this, maybe they're not comfortable discussing fees or discussing the price  of their treatment with the patient. Another reason may be the fact that if they make the price of their treatment cheaper than what it actually is, maybe more patients will say yes. Maybe they've had a price objection in the past and they don't like it and it makes them feel uncomfortable. So making the price of the treatment cheaper will then hopefully get more acceptance of yes and get obviously less price resistance. There's only just one small problem with this. The more times you reduce the price of treatments in your head, the more it's going to cost.  cost you. And the big problem is this, is that there's only two people within the practice who knows that a price reduction has taken place. That's you, because you keep doing it all the time, and of course your nurse. The patient themselves don't know that you have reduced the price and they automatically think that's the price of what it should be. In my next video I'm going to talk about the damage this can do to your income and the practice profits and that is just  just one quick tip that you can do to ensure that you never actually do this again."
