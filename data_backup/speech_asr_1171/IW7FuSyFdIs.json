It's supposed to be a package of some kind of gimmicky Video game VR visor. This is an array of infrared LEDs. In fact, let's turn them on Yay, most of them work This is a camera right here standard security camera. This is a stupid little soda bottle cap that I used for  focusing.  the  and the camera that I'm on now. So the video is going to dump, but I didn't patch in the audio. This camera does have audio and this does have little earbud earphones, but I was lazy and didn't feel like plugging in all the adapter cables. So I'm going to go through my house and I'm going to turn the infrared vision on and off. I'll turn the array on and off randomly through it so you can get a comparison of before the infrared and after the infrared.  so  so  so  so  you  so  so  so  you"
