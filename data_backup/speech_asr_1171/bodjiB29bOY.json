  "transcription": " There's an epidemic of separation amongst women. In a media climate that highlights photos of celebrities' cellulite, asks us to compare who is more attractive, and speculates on who's fighting with who or stealing whose man, all while distracting us from the very real problems our world faces. War, poverty, sexual violence. It's no wonder that women are so often  It's no wonder that we compare ourselves to other women, judge ourselves and our bodies harshly, and pass these wounds of shame and separation on to our children. Only to create a cycle of women feeling so trapped in their self-doubt and insecurity that we isolate ourselves from other women and stop ourselves from speaking out. Divide and conquer? We won't stand for it any longer. For nearly all of human history, we have lived together in community, supporting one another.  No matter what you were going through, good times or sad, there would be other women there to support you, celebrate you, encourage you, and care for you. When women come together to celebrate and support one another, shame and insecurity are brought into the light and we work together for healthier communities and a better future. In building construction, sisters are the supporting beams of a physical structure, and sistering happens when you reinforce an existing beam with another for support.  And really, that's what sisterhood is. The supportive structure that holds all of life together.  We rise in connection, support, and celebration of one another.  I'm gonna go ahead and get started.  Thank you, because the world will be set free by women who are free, and sisterhood is key to women's freedom."
