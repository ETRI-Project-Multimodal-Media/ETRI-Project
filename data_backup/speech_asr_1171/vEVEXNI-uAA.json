Just arrived in Auckland and here for a couple of days just to check out some of the riding, some of the tourist attractions and just get a feel for New Zealand before we head to Rotorua. Just gonna find a bit of shelter here. This heat's kind of pretty tough for a Scot.  not really used to it. First up I'm gonna head over to Waiheke and check out some of the mountain bike trails over there.  Just turned up at Riverhead Trails just outside Auckland for a little shred. You take my car and I'll kill you.  You ready?  Yeah mate!  I took the sneaky!  You"
