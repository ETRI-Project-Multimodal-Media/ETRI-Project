  "transcription": " All right, we're all set here. Captain Hill, thank you for stepping up to lead the department. I wish it was under better circumstances. After tonight, they will be. All right, take me through the details. We know Caden James is monitoring traffic in and out of the city. Airports, highways, ports. But the shoreline might be the blind spot. Specifically, right here, there's no satellite flyover for about 10 minutes. That's our window. SWAT has the perimeter, so no one's getting in or out without us knowing it.  Good. When do we make contact? Should be any minute. Mr. Mayor. I'm Alex Scott, Argus. Good to meet you. We good to move? Yes. All clear on shore. Exit, exit. What's wrong? Just some weird feedback. Are your comms line of sight? No, we're patched in. You gotta get those things off!  Gotta get the other drivers out of the water!  70 million dollars. At this point we've got maybe another day or two. What about the federal government? I mean, don't they have plans for this kind of stuff? Argus was our best shot and Caden James was ready for it. I think that we are on our own. So does that mean I go for it with the emergency bomb shelters? Yeah. We need a contingency. It won't save everyone, but it's a  It's a start. How's William holding up? Doing as well as can be expected. He's... holed up at an Argus safe house with Reza and a PlayStation 4. You look like you could use some rest. August him if you will. Like brother, like sister, I guess. Hey, don't worry, okay? Kanan James is not the first guy to try to take our city hostage. We will figure it out.  Caden James' hold on Star City has reached eight days and counting now with all routes in and out of the city under James' control. Though Mayor Queen has urged for calm, tensions are running high as the threat of the thermobaric bomb continues to loom.  That's a damn good question.  you"
