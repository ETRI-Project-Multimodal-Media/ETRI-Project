Ok. A Patriot Ordnance Factory. And that's a Sig what? Sig 5.56. 5.56. That's what I remember shooting at last time. You did? Yeah. I think you had just gotten it.  I got it! You got the cookie? I hit the cookie. It's pretty big really. I cut it. Part of it is still sitting there. The whole Oreo cookie thing is iron sights and offhand.  You must have missed that in this video, huh? Because that shot was too easy. Way out there, 50 yards.  I can't even see it very good in this camera.  I just started in mind you I'm still pretty I don't know. I think it should count but I understand. And I will vouch for it. And I think somebody I think last year somebody made a much farther shot at it. I think I heard a hundred yards. Yeah, that's that's a good shot. Yeah. I didn't know it was iron. If I remembered it I didn't remember it was iron sights.  I just took out an orange, but stupid me, didn't have the camera turned on.  I nailed that acorn next to it. Did you? Yeah. First shot! Woo! I won.  CZ, it's a 9mm with a .22LR conversion kit in it.  You know that you're safe.  Which one is that again? Damn, which one was that again?  Guess it's not going to answer me."
