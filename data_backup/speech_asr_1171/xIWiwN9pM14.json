Three years ago the elders brought a vision to the church called Compelled by Grace. One of the key mission statements was that we would reach out and be a blessing to the community. Last weekend we saw our students grab a hold of that vision, impact their world as they invited over a thousand of their friends for our Back to School Bash event. We saw over 60 of those students come to know Jesus Christ for the very first time as their Lord and Savior. We are so  proud of our students, so proud of so many of our volunteers, to really make a great impression of Jesus Christ onto the lives of these students.  Really our hope and prayer is throughout all of student ministries is that we would see kids come to know Jesus Christ and that we as a staff would then come alongside and disciple them up and help them become the men and women God intends for them to be. It was so great to see the vision fulfilled with this campus just full of students especially as we move into our brand new building from the game room and the lounge and the snack bar to the new junior high room the new club 56 room with just hundreds and hundreds of students. So great to be a part of what God's doing here at this church. So great to be part of student ministries.  And I would love nothing more than to invite all of you guys to come over. Come be a part of what we're doing. Be excited about seeing kids come to know Jesus Christ and get discipled up in their faith. We are so excited for what God's doing here."
