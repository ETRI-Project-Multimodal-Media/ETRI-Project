They knew what they wanted and their strong personality with Cartier's talents has created some of the most memorable and valuable jewellery collections we have known.  most important clients for Cartier. Maybe jewels were a way for them to create another life after all they had been against and all they had left and all the scandal that had been around them. They created a certain life of freedom and beauty and elegance and jewels were essential in that story. And two of the most famous are here in the show, the Flamingo and then the very famous brooch with the panther sitting on this big sapphire cabochon, who is one of the emblems  There's a whole area dedicated to Grace Kelly and I think one of the highlights is the engagement ring given to her by Prince Rainier which, although it's quite a simple setting, is in fact a beautiful 10-carat diamond that she wore in the film High Society. There are also other examples of her jewellery that because she was seen wearing them and photographing them,  we seem to know them. They're like moments from the past that help us to evoke the days of glamour that Grace Kelly so well embodied. Perhaps a Cartier jewel that is most fresh in all of our minds and that's linked to a very romantic moment is a tiara that Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, wore on her wedding day. It was lent to her by the Queen and it is a halo-style tiara with scroll motifs and it was made by Cartier in London in 1936. In fact, most of the jewels at the exhibition were probably  given as tokens of love. And if we look at them today, some of them more than 100 years old, you can still see the brightness of color of the stones, the freshness of the design, and hopefully the original intention of the giver, which was to delight."
