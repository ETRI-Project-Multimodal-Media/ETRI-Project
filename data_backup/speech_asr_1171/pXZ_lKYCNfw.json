This is Daniel, my best friend. I'm Shurat.  Sweet potatoes  Garlic  And your bacon And your sausages, lovely pork sausages And there's beef sausages and chicken sausages Catered for all It's nice, beef stir-fry And your rice, plain rice And your boiled eggs  One on salt, one on salt. Breakfast. In my cuckoo yam. Pulao for breakfast.  you"
