  "transcription": " Hi, I'm Nick from Dorman Products.  to maximize durability or performance. What might save a few dollars or pounds in the engineering process might be failure prone down the road. And there are often weaknesses that become clear over a vehicle's lifespan, but the manufacturer simply doesn't invest in redesigning their parts to correct those flaws or make it easy for owners to solve their problems at dealerships. Whenever Dorman's engineers find an opportunity to redesign an original equipment part or redefine the solution a dealership offers, we call it an OE fix. An OE fix part gives a service  technician or vehicle owner the freedom to fix a vehicle according to their priorities. That means redesigning a part to install faster, last longer, and prevent future failures. It also means redefining the original equipment service solution. For instance, if the dealership says you have to replace an entire assembly, we allow you to only replace the failure-prone component. Or perhaps if the dealer requires you to buy a number of individual parts for a common repair, we pre-assemble them for you for a faster repair.  Do we do all this? Because our mission is to put the aftermarket first and make it faster, easier, and less expensive to maintain your vehicle. That's why, whenever you need a replacement, check Dorman first."
