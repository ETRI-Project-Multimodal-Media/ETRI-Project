  "transcription": " You got an interview! Congratulations! But now what?  what kind of questions they're gonna ask you. Sit down with a friend and pull up mock interview questions and just try to answer as many as you can. That's one of the biggest things to be prepared for. You never know what they're gonna ask and it's always good to have just a huge array of questions so that you go in prepared as possible. Another thing that I've always found to be really helpful is to practice in front of a mirror so that you know what you look like when you answer questions. Because sometimes you can do a really puzzled look and you don't want to come across being confused or overwhelmed and it really helps to know what your face looks like when you answer questions.  or questions. Dress the part. When you go in for your interview, make sure that your look is relatively simple and that it doesn't overshadow your personality because ultimately they're hiring you for your personality and what you can bring to the table in that sense. So don't feel too much pressure to overdo your makeup and hair and outfit. A lot of times just simple colors and natural makeup make the best impression because they let your personality shine through. And just having a clean and polished look  is best, in my opinion.  It's always great to send to your future employer, like maybe a follow up email saying, thank you for taking the time to meet with me, because it really shows you that you're eager and you're passionate about the job."
