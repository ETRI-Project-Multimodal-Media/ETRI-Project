He came up to and he was, he had a rou he was hitting to 50 or so maybe below 2 50. And he what, what am I doing wro  I knew right then that every single guy is gonna go through that. Whatever walk of life you go into there are gonna be obstacles and I Thought it was very poignant about how you found happiness and were able to enjoy what you did You know is it was it easy to find that? Well, I think why you're playing the game of football you have to live in that moment It's understanding the incredible opportunity that you have at hand and just doing all you possibly can but for me That's when I leave the stadium. It's when I leave practice and I'm able to do other things that I'm passionate about as well It's about a balance for the last  I've traveled to 20 diffe been on the road for 200 But at the same time I've last three seasons than I last 11 years. So that's and football marry up wit allow me to come better How did you overcome a l deal with failures to mak In baseball, I think acro  I love it when people tell me I can't do something.  I love it when people tell me I'm not smart enough. I love it when people tell me there's not enough time in the day. I love it when people challenge me, because at the same time, them challenging me is me challenging myself in order to ultimately do what I want to do. I mean, in the great words of Frank Sinatra, you know, I'm going to do it my way. We'd like to thank everybody for coming by today."
