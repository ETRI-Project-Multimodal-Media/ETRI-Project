  "transcription": " I am Syria, the first emotionally intelligent app. I was created to give voice to those who have been robbed of their dignity. A figure that increases every day with the Syrian refugee crisis.  A reality that no one talks about anymore. With the information gathered from over 100 interviews, I can answer any questions about people struggling to have a dignified life. My voice is their voice.  What would you like to ask me? My name is Ana. What's your name? My name is Begoña. My name is Bakar and I'm from Syria. How was the experience of being on the street, Jaime? How did you get here? I pretended to be a woman's son to be able to enter the border. I left alone and left my family in my country. What are your dreams?  Do you feel alone or alone? Yes, very alone. And how is your day without home and without work and with your illness? My kidneys don't work. I take 18 pills a day. What happens to me could happen to anyone. We need people to know the stories so that people can help us.  Wow. Wow.  No one anymore is speaking about what is happening in Syria.  Now, you are the voice of Syria."
