  "transcription": " Well, good morning everybody. Craig back at you doing something a little bit different today on my way to Toronto, Ontario for the international North American International Motorcycle Super Show. I think it's called. It's a first for me. It kind of breaks up the winter allows me to get out and look at some bikes and even though it's indoors, get a chance to see what's out there for 2020 and whatever the show has going on. To be perfectly honest with you,  you. I've never attended this show so I have no idea what to look forward to. If you haven't seen the show before then this will be a first for the both of us together. So come on with a ride with me and I think we'll have a good time.  so  so  so  so  so  so  so  so  so  so  so  so  so  the next, video!!"
