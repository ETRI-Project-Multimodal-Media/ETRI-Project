  "transcription": " So  so  As part of any Guinness World Records food related attempt, one of our key requirements is that the food be distributed and eaten. The record to beat was 23 feet and 6.6 inches. I can now confirm that the calzone has a length of 59 feet 9.5 inches. It gives me great pleasure to confirm that Vaughn Pizza Fest in Rockford, Florida officially achieved  the new Guinness World Records title for longest count up."
