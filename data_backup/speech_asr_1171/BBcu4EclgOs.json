  "transcription": " I say life will bring discomfort and I discovered we all just suffer cuz no one feels that bad And it comes from one another we hurt each other just like a lover and don't think twice about that  And I feel like something's bad but hell I'm used to that I always turn my back And I wanna feel something but all I feel is pain I wanna make a change You either pick yourself up or you let yourself down life will always be tough  So who the fuck are you now? Will you make it along? Or do you need someone else? I don't need anyone I'll do it all by myself  I've got scars, put up my guard I don't wanna get torn apart I start to feel my heart Race faster, it's pumping hard And all I want is to be something That's why I just keep on running Can't stop what you don't see coming And you know I'm coming How can I trust you?  If you don't trust me I do what I do Cuz it is just me and nothing is new No, I'm not lucky. I work my ass off So I'll be some you either pick yourself up or you let yourself down Life will always be tough. So who the fuck are you now?  I'll do it all by myself"
