  "transcription": " From Alan Turing to Bill Gates, you could easily name a male that has contributed to the computing industry, right? But did you know that it was in fact a female, Ada Lovelace, who was the world's first programmer? I certainly didn't until recently. So it's no wonder that by 2040,  only 1% of the tech sector is expected to be female. And in 2016, this gender gap contributed to nearly 57,000 tech developer roles being unfilled. Now, I have an idea that could change all of this. An online platform that celebrates the achievements of inspiring women in tech, reaching anyone without any boundaries. Stereotypically, boys are connected to tech  through gaming, but it's different for girls. The platform would offer many collaborative coding challenges relating to aspects of a young woman's life, exciting even girls with no prior experience. For example, creating a chatbot that comforts its user, or coding part of an online shopping checkout, or writing a cipher that encrypts secret messages between friends.  Perhaps most importantly, the platform would also attempt to raise the negative stigma around the label geek, which seems to cause isolation when really all most teenage girls want to do is fit in. Girls in tech need to be redefined as vital for our future. So why is this important? Well, it is estimated that  if we were to close the gender gap, it would be worth £600 billion of the UK. Also, by increasing our gender's input on highly debated issues, such as the use of artificial intelligence, it would be diversifying the current way of thinking and could perhaps even majorly benefit the future of our species. Thank you.  you"
