But before we go ahead and test this thing out I'm gonna hand this over to Thomas to explain how all this is put together. Thomas  So the first thing we do when manufacturing any of our machines is fabrication. That is, we cut out all the necessary metal pieces that we need to put together. And then once all those pieces are cleaned up and refined, they're ready to be welded. Meanwhile, our friends in the electrical department work on cutting wires and putting all the components together on our brains to give it life. After they're welded, all the metal pieces are sandblasted to remove all the  impurities and make it much easier to be powder coated. They're subjected to high heat so that the painting sticks. And then finally we assemble the mower together putting all the mechanical pieces and the electrical parts making sure that everything's installed and now we're ready to test the thing before we ship it.  so  so  Well, I guess you could say after a test like that, this unit is ready to go."
