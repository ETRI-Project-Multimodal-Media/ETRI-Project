  "transcription": " It was a hot exchange in Port Harcourt recently when Bishop of Catholic Diocese of Sokoto, Matthew Kuka, engaged River State Governor Yesoike Onwese and the cultural violence in the country. The event, with the title Democracy in Nigeria, still many rivers to cross, was organized to mark the third anniversary  of Governor Wike's administration. At the event, Cook advised stakeholders to be patient because democracy in Africa is unstable. He accused the political class of being impatient, revealing that the only election perceived to be free and fair is one where friends, brothers, and associates are elected to power and government. Wike protested Bishop Matthew Cook's position, arguing that patience cannot be stretched to where individuals and state  subverts the course of justice. The governor cited the recent attack on a River State High Court."
