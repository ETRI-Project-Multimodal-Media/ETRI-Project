  "transcription": " In the Auto Line Garage this week we have the new Mazda 3, a Zoom Zoom car to be sure. And what I love about this car is it's so light and nimble feeling. It'll dart wherever you want it to go because the steering is so aggressive. This car goes exactly where it's pointed. On the other hand, what I don't like about it is for a performance car, this is hard to heel and toe with this manual transmission. I have to really crank my foot over, really twist my ankle to be able to heel and toe.  there's a little bit too much brake pedal travel for a good performance car. And the way it's geared, at 70 miles an hour, it's turning 3,000 RPM. Wish it didn't turn that high of an RPM at highway speeds. But don't let all this nitpicking turn you off to this vehicle. This is a fun car to drive.  you"
