  "transcription": " Okay, so this is interesting. So I'm in Great Britain working on this project here trying to make over, you know, basically a playing part for this village, right? Well, I've met some people that are doing this for a living.  called a cob wall. Now it's basically building with the earth. These guys actually travel the world and actually build earth homes. They make houses out of mud, straw, and sand. And what I'm finding out is these things are not only durable, but they're breathable, which means if it gets wet, it dries out and lets the inside of your home also breathe. Now what are the advantages to having a home built out of clay and straw?  So if you can imagine this material, I mean, the processing of this material is minimal, right? Even though we're using a machine, all that has to be done is dug up from the ground, right? So we're digging up out of the ground. We're using local clay, we're using local aggregate and straw. But with this, with cob, this actually retains heat even better, so it acts as a thermal mass storage. It's also what you call a Dutch oven, the things are made out of heat, so when it gets warm, it gets even warmer. These simple materials are very intelligent materials. Interesting that something that comes from  from earth, soil, dirt, it's actually a more intelligent way to go than technology.  It's clay and with a mixture of a little bit of this stuff which is, I forget the name of it, aggregate. And they have to mix it all together with their feet. That's what these guys are doing right now. They're actually throwing the clay mixture, the aggregate, into this thing, a little bit of water, then they add the straw. The straw actually works as like rebar. It actually holds the thing together so it doesn't crack.  Okay, I'm gonna go get you guys some help because it sounds like it'd be easier if you guys had a few more answers.  Perfect."
