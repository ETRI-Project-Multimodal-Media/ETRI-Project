Is there a place? Is there a time?  So get to use us, live up, and don't you give up. I know we can make it in life. Just be focused, don't be obnoxious. That's not the righteous road of life. Get to use us, live up, don't you give up. Glory to the people you must survive. Just be focused, don't be obnoxious, no. So many times we go through days without food to eat, mama. So many nights we sleep in the dark.  Time is against us. Into altar. Glory to God.  Let me see a beer, Warren, don. But I'm all life, you know? Boy, my father say, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."
