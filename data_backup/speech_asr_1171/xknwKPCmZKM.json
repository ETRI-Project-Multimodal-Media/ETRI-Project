  "transcription": " How's it going everyone? It's Jake from NorCal here in the backyard. I'm gonna try out the Falcon Gotcha shotgun. It's a single shot shotgun. You pump it once and then you can't pump it again. Comes with a hopper. About 120 of the 50 caliber paintballs fit in it. I'm gonna be shooting at a target that is this blue  cooler right there about 30 feet away"
