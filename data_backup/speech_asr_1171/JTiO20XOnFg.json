  "transcription": " Since Tupac Shakur's passing, many pieces of memorabilia from his life have found their way onto the auction block. But now a new and unusual piece has made its way to the auction block, his diamond nose stud. The Black Heritage auction has announced selling the nose ring he wore on the cover of the LP All Eyes on Me. The bidding is expected to start around $15,000 to $20,000, though there are reports  that the Black Heritage Auction is facing lawsuits from the estates of Tupac's late mother, Afina Shakur. She alleges that the auction did not come by the items on the auction block legally. The estate has taken legal action against other auctioners in the past. Some of the other items that have been auctioned off are some of Tupac's handwritten lyrics and the car he was shot in. Bidding on Tupac's lots will begin April 7th, the same day Tupac is set to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  you"
