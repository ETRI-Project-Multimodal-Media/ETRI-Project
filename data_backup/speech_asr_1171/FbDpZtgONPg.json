  "transcription": " Basil's looking a little ratty because I have not been keeping up with it, keeping up with watering. Well, I need three cups of this stuff tonight to make some pesto. So I'm just going to be plucking some, some of the better looking leaves, and I'm going to trim it down quite severely because it's beginning to bolt. See, there's some bolting right there. This, you pluck it off.  It makes your basil smell skunky and taste skunky. It loses that good smell. Some fresh leaf growth. Out of this I ought to be able to have enough to make some superpest.  foreign  foreign  foreign  Poco contante, poco contante, poco contante."
