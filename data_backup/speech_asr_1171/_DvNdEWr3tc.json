  "transcription": " Did you manage to break the net before that? To be honest, I don't remember.  I thought I scored, but then the puck went left, so then I wasn't sure again. And Guus was celebrating, so I was like, OK, it must have been a goal. So I celebrated.  He plays against all the best players. You have to be close to him, don't let him go, and do your job well.  No. I play the same way. I play all the time. Now I get a lot of ice time and when it's bigger games you want to play better. For me I try to play the same way I played last year when I was in the beginning of the season when I wasn't good enough to play. Now I'm good enough to play all of a sudden.  I play as I played, and I had a lot of free time last season, so I don't feel any pressure.  Do you think that the main advantage is the attack? Actually, no, because we have not only excellent attack, but also great goalkeepers, very good defenders, good coaching staff and we are generally good as a team. Thank you very much!"
