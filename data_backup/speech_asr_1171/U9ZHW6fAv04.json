If you want more tips, tricks, and tutorials on NativeScript, make sure you subscribe and click the bell button. So let's talk about short import deprecation and what it means for your apps going forward.  As of version 5.2, NativeScript has deprecated short imports. Those look like this.  here  tns-core-modules-application and this one is going to become tns-core-modules-platform. So the long form is tns-core-modules and then the module that you're trying to find. Everything is coming from tns-core-modules. Let's do this utils one also. tns-core-modules utils utils and now TypeScript is happy. Alright, let's try building this now. I'm going to save everything. There's one more here.  Okay, now it's happy. I'm going to run this app just to make sure everything works. By the way, this app here is for the NativeScript Core Pro course. It's a course where I show you how to build the entire app from start to finish using all the NativeScript features. And if you prefer Angular, we build the exact same app, but the Angular version of it in the NativeScript with Angular Pro course. You can find both of those courses on nativescripting.com.  know about it so go change those imports don't delay and if you have any NativeScript questions for me go ahead and ask me down in the comments or on Twitter I'm at Digitalics and make sure you subscribe to this channel and put a little bell so you don't miss anything. Alright, see you next time!  you"
