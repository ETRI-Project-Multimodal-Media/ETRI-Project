  "transcription": " When I am down and oh my soul so weary When troubles come and my heart burdened be  And I am still and wait here in the silence Until you come and sit a while with me You raise me up so I can stand on mountains You raise me up to walk on stone mountains  I am strong when I am on your shoulders You raise me up to more than I can be  You raise me up so I can stand on mountains You raise me up to walk on stormy seas I am strong when I am on your shoulders  You raise me up to more than I can be More than I can be  You raise me up so I can stand on mountains You raise me up to walk on stormy seas I am strong when I am on your shoulders  I  Oh  Go! Go play, go play, go play, go play, go play, go play, go play Go! Go!  You"
