  "transcription": " Liheufuk is the continuation of a legacy of Australian Chinese restaurants. I didn't want to have a Chinese restaurant in Melbourne. I really wanted a Melbourne restaurant that explored Chinese cuisine. I moved from Sydney to Melbourne to open this restaurant. And when I first saw this location, I thought this is just iconic.  The graffiti, you know, an old building, a bit of a search, and I thought that was going to resonate with what we're trying to create here. In terms of the design brief, the biggest thing was to have it so it kind of broke away from perceptions. I like the idea of putting like a gold or a shiny metal through here, but not gold, so we arrived at brass. I wanted dark timber because at the time it was very fashionable to have light timber. I wanted it so you walk in here and be like, oh, this could be anything. You don't have a preconceived notion in terms of how the place looks and feels.  you have it once you start eating the food. If you put a little bit of care in every step of the way, you can't help but create something amazing. One of the things I kind of wanted to create in terms of food was what we called new classics. The design of this is because they're almost non-seasonal. So the strive to design something that's consistent for every customer at all times of the year. If you only order these dishes, you'll have a great time because they represent exactly what we're trying to achieve.  is my new style Chinese restaurant. And it's full of bold design and it's part of a city that's so vibrant in its art and architecture. And it pushes my creativity and what we offer at the restaurant."
