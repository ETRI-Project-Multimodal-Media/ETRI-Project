  "transcription": " The race this weekend went very well. First of all, we had a red flag, which Stuart went down and I was in second at the time. And then we had a red flag, so we had to come back to the line and regroup and get going again. And I started around eighth or seventh, and there was a bunch of really good guys that I was battling with. So I kind of worked my way through the pack up to the front and ended up with that win. So it was very cool to be able to win.  come through the pack and win it the way I did. It made it that much better for sure. But you know those guys are going to be right there in the next rest of the series trying to hunt me down or me trying to hunt them down. But they're always going to rise to the occasion. I mean you think that like when you're just catching guys you know you're like, I'm in a spot to where if I just be calm and patient and just pick a spot to pass these guys I could do it. So there's always that thought in your head for sure.  get a good start and be up there and just get some points you know get some good points towards the uh towards the series and hopefully just keep this good momentum going but anything can happen. We race dirt bikes and they're pretty unpredictable so oh yeah I slid on the slip of a triple and I got clipped it and then got whiskey throttle off of a berm and uh definitely not the way I wanted to start my day on Saturday but uh yeah we salvaged it and came through but yeah it definitely was a sketchy moment.  I landed in people because that's where they stage for this and I felt so bad. There was one guy but he's okay, nothing broken but yeah, kind of a bummer that I landed on him. The gear was awesome. That day, Anaheim 1 was the first day that I saw that gear and it was really cool. I think it looked good on the bike too. It feels pretty unreal, it still kind of shocks.  another good weekend and move forward."
