  "transcription": " Come on again  Shake the bane shake the bane This is a female that I sold a few months back that has had no training and I want to get her on the level of one of her little mate sisters now that she's back at my camp Now come down and hit the ground. Stand up. Hit the ground. Just hit it. Run back up. Good girl. I have been using this method for over 20 years  It's a very good method to putting the trigger word into my puppies and your young puppies. It works and get the dogs very hyped. That was exactly what I was looking for, a bark. Next I'll get this dog to scream and holler in a few more sections.  This time come over here and just come out here and you ain't gotta shake. Come over here and just hit the ground and be moving your feet back and forth like your leg. Ready? Come on.  This is the sneak move I call the guy peeking from behind the tree but you can half see him. This is a good method as well. Watch it.  At the end of this video you're going to see the same female scream and holler and take a bite from these simple methods I use here.  There you go. I want my dog. You're so stupid man. Go, go, go, go. You can move it a little bit. Go behind the truck. Go right there. Stop.  Now that was great dude That's great now now we got my bitch where I want This is a Quatro daughter bred to a daughter Carlos Van Voss and Donna  Good girl! Good girl! Good girl!
