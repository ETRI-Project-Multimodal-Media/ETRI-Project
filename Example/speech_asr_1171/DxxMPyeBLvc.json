  "transcription": " My name is Kenneth Levert and I'm a competitive athlete. Today I'm going to challenge some bodybuilders here at the world famous Muscle Beach to competitions of strength looking like this. Normally we probably use like a vinyl cap but it's gonna be stronger.  Old school latex. Strong. Strong is probably better for what I'm going to be doing. Yeah, I'm going to torture test this makeup. Feels like I'm getting a gnarly facelift. My eyebrows are being pulled into the back of my skull. Beautiful. All right, show time. Got to get pumped up.  How are you doing? Good, good. How are you? Great! Oh wow! Very impressive, very impressive. How are we doing? Good, sir. Young man, what supplements do you take? I love my creatine.  What do you use, man?  84  You wanna hop in for a little warm up? Of course young man, of course. What do you say we step it up a little? Alright. You pick the weight. Are you ready? Oh, you're talking my language now. Let's put those 45s on. Okay.  Thank you very much  Just keep doing it. Just keep doing it. Get strong every day. All right."
