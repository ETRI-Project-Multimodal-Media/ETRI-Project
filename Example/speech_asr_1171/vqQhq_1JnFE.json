  "transcription": " As a radio operator you can expect to deal with in excess of 70 incidents per shift. They could be as diverse as ranging from a stolen cat right through to a murder scene. You need to have a good command and control ability. You need to be able to deal efficiently under pressure and also be a team player. The qualities required for a good radio operator are a sense of level-headedness. The information that we give needs to be accurate and timely.  in order that jobs can be dealt with in an efficient manner. The diversity of incidents can range from the sublime to the ridiculous. You've got large-scale fights, large-scale road traffic collisions and literally down to somebody ringing in wanting to complain because they can't get through to Simon Cowell on the X-Factor."
