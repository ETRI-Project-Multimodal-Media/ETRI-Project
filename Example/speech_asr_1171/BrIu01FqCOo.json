  "transcription": " I've been asked by a few youtubers and When I'm out on my motorbike, they've been asking what is that stupid thing on my head? Well, I'm gonna show you in the summer. I don't like wearing a full face helmet and the problem with a peak helmet, especially on the free ride is you  struggle when you come into a hill to look up. So I started wearing this 661 mountain bike helmet. It has got some pretty good protection on it and the mountain bikers actually ride faster than I do. This one was designed by my son and he put the Rockstar energy drink stickers on it and he put his own special design on the back which is based on  the I think it was the movie Superbad where they could not stop drawing Godzilla type penises so he drawed a super bad one and he put it on the back of the helmet because it is an helmet no pun intended but anyway this is the one I'd wear and if you watch my videos of me out on the bike when I pass ramblers and walkers  Normally they sort of like shout and scream at you but when I go past them they laugh. Probably because of the helmet and how stupid I look. But there it is. There's a close-up of the helmet I do use and I like it. It's got the GoPro stickers on it so I can film people behind me and in front and it's a good all-round hat or helmet.  you"
