  "transcription": " Good morning, we're at the Tickett and Transportation Center waiting for the Moron Rail. It is 7 in the morning and Extra Magic Hour starts in an hour. We're in the Magic Kingdom and we're waiting for the welcome show to start and it's really sunny. Look at the crowd! There's so many people!  We're in the first row  We're now headed to my home in Frontierland. I want to go on Big Thunder Mountain. My mom doesn't like this type of ride, so she's gonna wait for me. It's a 9.03. I don't know if I messed up the timing before when I was walking forward, but it was 8-ish. Now it's 9. Splash looks like it's broken because the effects aren't on yet, so they probably have it delayed opening. But Big Thunder Mountain looks like it has long lines, so maybe someone let me in through FastCase. I don't know, but I'm like waiting for the rides I want to go on.  So just an update, after Splash Mountain we did Haunted Mansion and it's a small world and I didn't realize that in a small world we have a magic band that says goodbye to you with your names on the screen.  It's really crowded, really hot, and you wouldn't think it's a game day. I think it's like August.  So we're leaving the park it's about three o'clock it's a very long day we've been there for Seven hours we did a lot we pretty much did almost everything in the park. We used like seven fast passes today  more and we have our dinner reservation at Boma later for my mom's birthday so I guess I'll see you then so see you real soon. We're walking to the Animal Kingdom Lodge because we have our dinner reservation at Boma. We found a giraffe. There's a lot of people on their balconies looking out. So we're currently at Boma and I just finished my first plate and I'm about to go for plate number two. All the same food as last time and it's really good.  you"
