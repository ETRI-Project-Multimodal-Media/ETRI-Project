But this year for my guests, I wanted to do something really different. So I thought why not make some cookies. Not just any plain, jane, boring cookies. We're going to make some Apple Pie Cookies. Hi guys, I'm Bhumika. Walk with me through this recipe, And I'm going to fill your house with the warmth of cinnamon, And sweetness of apples. It's going to smell oh so delicious. Let's get started.  Let's start by creaming our Butter and Sugar together. This is 1 cup of Butter and 1 cup of Sugar. The Butter and Sugar looks nice and fluffy. Now let's add in a chopped up Apple. This was a nice delicious Kashmiri Apple. I've just peeled it and chopped it into small pieces.  Mix this into the Butter and Sugar. Now let's add in 3 fourth cup of Flour. 1 fourth tsp of Salt. And 1 tsp of Baking Powder. Fold this in carefully, don't over mix this batter.  Our cookie dough is now ready. Let's go and chill this in the fridge for 15 minutes. In this bowl, I have 3 tbsp of Caster Sugar. To which I'm going to add 1 tsp of Cinnamon.  We will use this mixture to coat our cookie dough balls. So they will crisp up from the outside in the oven. Now that our cookie dough is nice and chilled, let's roll them into small balls. Now we'll roll this into our Cinnamon Sugar.  And place it on the baking pan. Press it down gently. Place the cookies a little apart from each other as they will expand while baking.  Let's bake these at 160 degrees Celsius for 15 minutes.  My cookies are now ready. They are so comforting, they have my heart. I'm sure your guests will love it too. When you try this recipe, do share your experience with me in the comment section below.
