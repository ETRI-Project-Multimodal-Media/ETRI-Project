  "transcription": " It's just really exciting to be here like after we've been practicing for so many months It's fun to get to finally practice for real this time And put out something for somebody else. I think we're gonna win. We have really strong dishes. I think  We have a lot of good players on our team. It's pretty intense, but it's excitement mostly. That's what's keeping me going. Lots of adrenaline happening. I'm making cauliflower bites with a spicy cheese sauce. I didn't think it was going to be this chaotic, but it is.  I'm making the snap crackle chocolate chicken which is basically the star dish kind of and it's breaded with my favorite seasonings as the secret recipe.  I felt like my stomach was gonna come out of my throat. It was, my heart was beating so fast. It was just, you know, we were just so excited.  It's so good!  I'm ecstatic. I don't know how I'm containing myself right now. It's all that we worked for and it's three years in a row that we've won and it just feels amazing. I'm really happy we got first place. It's just bursting with rainbows and unicorns and stuff coming out of me. This is a really good feeling, honestly.  you"
