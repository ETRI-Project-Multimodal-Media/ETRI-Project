  "transcription": " Come on! Two, three, four, five, six, seven! Come on! Two, three...  And he improves and of course let's not forget there is that oh  Wow  And the count reached 10  for a second time in this fight. And he gets up on the count of eight, and the corner from McClellan is about to stop this fight. Left hooks, and Moody Badigan, before the towel could get thrown in, stops the fight just seconds ago here in the fifth.  I couldn't even get it out.  70 pounds reach. Down goes Dabaka here in round two. Two uppercuts. You know, that's an awkward combination right there. Two uppercuts back to back. The right hand and the left hand. That dropped Dabaka right where he stood. My goodness. Beautiful short right by Dabaka. I'm not going to take it. Of Dabaka right now. I'm throwing in the towel with him. I'm a young fighter. He's young. He don't need to be taking this type of punishment right now. But that body shot hurt Dabaka right there.  Right back to the head. And the reason why the ref is not stopping him and stepping in the action is because the boxer is coming back, and he finally decides to step in and stop this action. If nobody else is gonna do it, that is the job of Raul Caís Sime."
