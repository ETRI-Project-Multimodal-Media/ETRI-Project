If you look right here you can see that it's got a roll right automatic tarp. And while we're on the subject of the tarp I'd like you guys to know that it's a 22 ounce tarp so it won't rip and tear as easily.  The landing gear is aluminum peg style drop down. It's in great shape. You can see the side of the trailer. There's no welds or cracks or anything like that. It's been well maintained. And when we get to the back, you can see that this trailer has eight aluminum wheels. You can look at the subframe and tell that it's been taken care of. The gussets right here, there's no cracks or anything like that. It's been, you know, it's ready to go. It's beautiful.  You can see that the grain locks are intact. There are no welds on them or cracks or anything like that. That's hard to find in a used dump trailer these days. All the bows are in place, the trailer's flat, the floor's in good shape.  You can see that this trailer is equipped with air ride suspension. And again, all the gussets, there's no welds, there's no cracks or anything like that. The only thing that this trailer's missing is a truck to hook it up to. Aero Truck Sales, give us a call today."
