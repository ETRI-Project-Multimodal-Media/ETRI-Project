  "transcription": " Phenomenal, creative and beautiful. Incredible is so generic but incredible definitely comes to mind. Those people are amazing. Mind-blowing. It was really impressive. Like, full on. I definitely enjoyed the part where they had the girl just defended right up on the pole right near the lights. That was outstanding. She was up so high. When the girl was up on like these little sticks it was so cool. It was nerve-wracking like to see if she was going to fall or not. The woman like being tossed into the air and spinning around and somehow managing to land in the arms of another person  Amazing just what the human body can do. Come and see it for sure. It's like a better version to Cirque du Soleil. Definitely come and see this. For everybody you know. Everyone. Anyone. Everybody, anybody. It was just beautiful."
