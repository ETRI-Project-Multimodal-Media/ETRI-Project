  "transcription": " Let it all flow out like a river running You cannot deny this, that your kingdom's falling again It never ends  You gotta see a level ending shambles You learn to breathe but you can see you're drowning We rise and fall until a different level Let your life drain out You're fighting back, you'll know what you've been thinking Oh, are you burning? Can you see you're sinking? Hiding shadows, can you fight your demons? Can you fix yourself?  You rise and fall, like a comet about to end You could end it all, but there was left there to defend It never ends You gotta see your level landing shambles You run away but you can see you're drowning We rise and fall into a different land  I know you think that our new king isn't fair Leaves you gasping for air Breathe in all this despair This ocean of hate  You're landing shambles You are not brave but you can see you're drowning We rise and fall onto a different level Let your last drain out You're fighting back, don't know what you've been thinking Oh, are you burning? Can't you see you're sinking? Hiding in shadows, can you fight your demons? Can you fix yourself?  you"
