  "transcription": " When we talk about quantum computing, it's a completely  different game.  use the world's most powerful device to combat the world's most challenging problems. We can attack global warming. Security. What are the boundaries of machine learning? Fighting diseases. The possibilities of quantum computers are endless. Microsoft has the best and the brightest working on this problem. It's really happening.  The world progresses very fast when we're building a quantum computer. What the world wants to know is what happens when we turn the machine on. What problems will be solvable with a computer that computes in a billion parallel universes at the same time?"
