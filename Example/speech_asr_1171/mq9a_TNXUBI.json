  "transcription": " So this is our 2019 Jeep Wrangler JL  two-door sport turbo. It's got our three and a half inch x-factor mid-arm stage one. It's a very, very, you know, simple suspension setup that performs absolutely great. The goal with this Jeep, and I'll be honest, my boss didn't like it, was that we wanted, I wanted to come out here and show that a very simple, you know, basic lift kit, you know, from us can eat any of the big trails out here. And it has, it absolutely has.  You can go have fun in the dunes, you can take on any of the big trails and the Jeep performs flawlessly. It's got Dyna-Trac Pro-Rock 44 front axle and a factory Dana 44 Rubicon rear axle that we swapped into it. 37 inch Nitto trail grapplers with 17 inch Method beadlocks. It's got Nemeziz flares and Nemeziz rear inners and Artec front inners.  The savvy crawler light bumpers that are really killing it on the approach angles and everything. A worn winch with factor 55 flat link and the fairlead. This thing is absolutely killing it out here in the rocks. People have been hating on the 2.0 turbos all over the internet, but you know what? It gets out here. It does work. I spent a full day on cliffhanger and used less than a quarter tank of gas and had an absolute ball.  This one's got nitro 538s in it, which is, you know, you would think a little excessive for 37s, but man, it still cruises at about 2200 RPM at 80 miles an hour and it eats rocks all day. Next, you know, on another Jeep out here, we're prototyping 3-link long arm setups, and that's absolutely, you know, killing it. You know, and we're going to bring 3-link long arms into the two-doors as well. There's a lot of, you know, small differences between the two.  and we're finding the solution so we can bring them out."
