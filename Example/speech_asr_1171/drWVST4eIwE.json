  "transcription": " Oh  Spencer Spencer Yeah, so we were just playing a chicken shit bingo  And then they put a chicken in a cage and the cage has like a grid on the bottom and where the chicken poops is decides the winner. Yeah, so it's like kind of a big thing in Austin. I guess they've been doing it for a long time. So I had number two. He shit on number 20. God damn it, which is right next to mine. I guess you win like 120 bucks or something if you do it. You get half of the pool. Yeah, half of the pool, which is probably 81 times two divided by two.  80. 80 I guess? Yeah. So 80 bucks? Yeah. But, oh well. I'll just have to come back and do this every single day. Yeah. Right on. So, um. It was pretty fun. They have good drinks here. So at least we got that out of it. And free hot dogs too. Oh yeah. And here comes the chicken. Oh, there's the man of the hour. So, what do you have to say about this event today?  Yeah, great thoughts, great thoughts from the chicken on chicken shit bingo. Thank you very much sir."
