  "transcription": " Hi everyone, I'm your host MJ Ball and welcome to Behind the Handlebars. As motorcycle sales continue to fall, Harley-Davidson has announced that the company is closing their Kansas City, Missouri plant and will move all operations to York, Pennsylvania by July of 2019. The closing will eliminate roughly 800 jobs with approximately 450 jobs getting added to the York plant. This marks a bit of a rough year for Harley-Davidson as U.S.  sales fell 8.5% and international sales fell 3.9%. President and CEO Matt Levitich said that the decision to consolidate their final assembly plant was made after careful consideration and that the Kansas City Assembly will leave a legacy of safety, quality, collaboration and manufacturing leadership. I'm MJ Ball and this has been Behind the Handlebars."
