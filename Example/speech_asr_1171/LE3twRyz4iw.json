  "transcription": " Chillin?  What you got?  with shattered schemes, right? My niggas is dead focused Magic when I speak to the beat, hoax focused Play Solution with your chain and diamond rings Take it to the pawn shop and get it some loose change Ante up, kidnap fools Self preservation, acquired a red jewel from an old soul Mind sharp as a tack though, gonna climb to the ceiling With a magical flow, let's go  Straight jacket, guzzling champagne, campaign Maintain stay in my lane with a bag of chips, quarter water, some hood This shit keep the nigga grounded, clear minded, not clouded Money forecast, fix the end claim when they doubt it  When the poor your bones whistle, skin grab, bag your toe tag Walking through the wrong hood, wearing the wrong flag Not one to brag, flow sharp with jet lag Cause a n***a mine floating, thinking I send bad In a different world, silver spoon with mad cash But instead I got the hood, duct tape and ski mask Let my pants sag, for the critics? Kiss my ass, dealt with the pain Stomped in the rain with a broken umbrella Trying to cover my frame with a cup of hope Spit dope and jump rope  I just wanna celebrate, celebrate, celebrate, celebrate, celebrate, celebrate I just wanna celebrate, celebrate, celebrate, celebrate, celebrate  Lock your hands to whatever you're doing.  you"
