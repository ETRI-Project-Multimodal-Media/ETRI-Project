  "transcription": " I'm a fitness artist, I'm a trainer, I'm a dancer. I started dancing when I was about seven years old. It was the only time that I felt connected to myself. I felt like when I was in the dance room, I was able to emote and express myself to the fullest capacity. I like to motivate people through dancing and fitness and health. So I share my challenges and what I've been through to show them that everything you see has taken a lot of hard work  and a lot of determination and perseverance. Because I'm a girl on the go, ideas come to me very quickly with a lot of oomph. Having something I can write on that's fast and easy is really valuable to me because sometimes I'm on the computer or the phone, I don't retain the same information as quickly. I want people to feel what it's like to have that energy. If you dream big enough, you work hard enough, and you never give up, you can achieve anything.  you"
