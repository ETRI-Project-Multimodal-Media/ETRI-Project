  "transcription": " This is a short video about what one of my goals was prior to starting the course. And it was to clean the shed up. As you can see I've um... New desk, computer. Um, there's still a fair bit of work. The whole point of this was logistically. All the information, have all this information  flow beading, books, things you pick up, paperwork etc. etc. It just comes in and you need a process or a method to be able to store it. So this was my goal around the back here. You can see I've digitised a lot of stuff but it's just sitting in boxes. I don't know how well that has all been organised. So there's a piece of work there.  And then in each one of these boxes there's a different amount of fullness of papers and things like that, which is around the back, so it has been digitised at one point, but just need to get around to figuring all that out in a bit more, so, we'll, um,  that's kind of the state of play. I guess the other thing is that it's not all mine, so you're trying to organise other people's stuff as well."
