So I don't know about you all, but I've been hearing a lot about this keto thing and I'm all, can I do that as a vegan? Truth is, I really don't know yet, but I'm going to be making a lot of recipes in the coming weeks, months, whatever, that are keto-friendly vegan recipes and we're gonna see if I can come up with a meal plan. I promise. But we're gonna try.  So today we have a special recipe that you all voted on. Some spicy portobello mushroom tacos. I love tacos any day of the week. And even though it's Thursday, I'm like taco Tuesday. You should know, I'm a huge freaking geek. Also, I have a bed head. Alright, let's do this.  I feel like maybe I got the wrong kind of stuff there, but we'll see. It's going with the flow people. I'm gonna try them now.  Well, that was pretty damn good. Two thumbs up. Keep them coming. I'll keep having you guys vote. I'm just doing it sporadically now, but I'm gonna go eat the rest of those. I'm kinda calling my name. Alright, have a good day. Bye, see you soon."
