  "transcription": " I'll conclude by talking about APs and then take your questions. The AP stands for Advanced Placement. AP is given only once a year. It's in May. It's given in a wide variety of subjects, not just the SAT subjects that I mentioned, but beyond that. There's an AP in Environmental Science. There's an AP in Computer Science.  There's an AP in Virgil. There's an AP in European history. Students who have learned those subjects well may want to impress colleges by taking the AP. No college requires AP to my knowledge. In part because it's very expensive. They're $95 for each test to take. Some schools don't have as many courses available for AP. So the colleges have made their requirements  based on SAT 2. But as an admissions, well, an admissions arrow in your quiver, an admissions asset, showing an SAT, sorry, showing an AP with a 4 or a 5. 5 is the best score, 1 is the worst score. A 4 or a 5 is impressive. It's the equivalent of 4 of getting about a 750 on your SAT subject test. A 5 is the equivalent of about an 800.  on your subject test. So they are impressive, not requirements, but nice if your student is strong enough in a subject come April or May, I would encourage signing up and taking one more AP test."
