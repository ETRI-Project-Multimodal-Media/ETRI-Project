  "transcription": " Music  how do we judge, how do we decide what awards to give? And each of our judges is qualified in a technical area, and I do my best to assign them to the projects that would match their expertise. And then they look at the projects and use such criteria as creativity, thoroughness, clarity, scientific thought, and use either a ranking system or a scoring system,  And then the little team of judges in each area gets together and they help talk it over and decide on the winner. And we end up with a grand prize winner for the overall prize that goes to the ISAF as well."
