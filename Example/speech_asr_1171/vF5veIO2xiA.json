  "transcription": " I enjoyed that, I have to say.  Overall a bit too quickly, you know, it's a new car to me so you're sort of finding your feet in the next thing to check it flex out. But you know we're third in class, I think maybe seventh or eighth overall so we've got a good chance for the race which is the most important thing so yeah, I enjoyed it.  Yeah, really good, I enjoyed that, you know, P2 in class, so, you know, some fantastic  I was out there and it's just good to get more laps in the car. I was getting faster and faster every lap. Just trying to make progress through the pack. I really enjoyed driving the car, driving on the Grand Prix circuit. It's always nice to get a little trophy at the end of the day. Got a bit of a sweat on. I only did eight laps, but it's surprisingly hot in that little Brabham. The car was fantastic. The balance, especially through the high-speed corners, was brilliant.  just a small oversteer, small drift the whole way through the corners. So really enjoyed it and yeah hopefully be back for more. So yeah big thanks to Sam Thomas, Sam Thomas Racing, all the guys for a great weekend."
