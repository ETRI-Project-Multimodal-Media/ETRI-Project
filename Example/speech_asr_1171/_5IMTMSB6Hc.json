  "transcription": " Yeah, this event is very unique because most people come from all over the world to compete here. So it creates a pretty unique vibe between everybody. El Colorado has been awesome. It has the perfect access to the side country of Santa Fe. The face is beautiful.  You know, it's like a playground, a big mountain playground. We got two feet of snow right before the event and we had this window two days where it was bluebird and perfect. The condition for this event could not be any better. Well, it's August and here we are skiing powered. We are ready to kick things off for the North Face Chilean Free Skiing Championships.  I like this  and there's a good motivation for skiing here. I think it's just beginning for these guys, so it's really cool to be part of it. I think having a South American stop is kind of crucial to have it truly be a global tour. This competition here in Chile is a perfect venue to get people involved. It's right off the road, they can see it. I think that it opened a lot of eyes to seeing what free skiing is all about.  Very impressive to ski a face and at the bottom the guys who are looking you is Hugo Harrison and Ian McIntosh. To have Hugo Harrison come up and tell me that I did a great job, he was impressed, it means a lot. The North Face as a sponsor, it's pretty awesome that they give so much to this little niche sport.  you"
