You don't have to ever think about what you're going to do next, or food, or the activities. It's an amazing hike. We learned about the different layers of the glacier. Hot chocolate. What more could you ask for? Thank you. You're welcome. I love the back roads bikes. They're lightweight, but they feel really sturdy.  We'll have different shots of Moraine Lake and you'll notice the lake actually changes color. Delicious lunch and now we're on the road again. Today was a wonderful day on back roads. I've been on five trips and today was one of the most beautiful  on an awesome day. Every trip is different and every one has been really unbelievable. So right behind me is Hector Lake, one of our beautiful blue green glacial lakes, the Rocky Mountains. It's fed by the Wapta Glacier and behind that the Wapta Icefield. Pretty awesome. I think the guides at Backroads are great. They're very enthusiastic. They take us everywhere, do everything. It makes vacationing super easy and fun. I love everything about this trip. I love all of the points of interest that we went to.  and it met all of my expectations. All the leaders we've had, whatever area of the world or country you're in, they seem to really know that area. They appreciate the culture of the towns and cities you're visiting. They tell you good stories. You learn a lot. Today, I mean, we were learning about the geology. What makes the Rocky Mountains what they are? Oh, I love it.  you"
