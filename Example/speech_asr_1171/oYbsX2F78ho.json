  "transcription": " In the last decade we added a multi-alphabet support in order to be able to filter non-Latin alphabet against each other. For example, Arabic against Arabic or Korean against Korean.  consideration mechanism to be able to filter those alphabets against Latin. So to be able to filter Russian, Japanese or Arabic against Latin equivalents. Another major change was to be able to filter customer data files against PEP lists. So to be able to load those really big lists in memory and filter them against large customer files by using a multi-threaded  process. We also added a scoring engine, one of the latest enhancements that have been implemented, that allows business users to define a meaningful score in order to ease decision making and focus on high-risk alerts. Our filtering approach is based on 20 years of close collaboration with our customers and continuous feedback on our filtering solutions.  It's performant as it filters hundreds of millions of transactions every day. It maximizes search coverage, raising all relevant hits, then providing powerful tools to reduce false positive alerts and prioritizing high risk alerts. And it's independent from referential data, exhaustive referential data, which means that it automatically enriches list data with multilingual synonyms,  for partial and inverse names. And for example, for embargoes, we also add the main cities and the country's names."
