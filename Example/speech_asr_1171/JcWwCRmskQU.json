  "transcription": " 1v1 in the centre circle with two small goals in the perimeter. Attackers can use any of their changes of direction, fake or feint, or stop and start moves to beat the opponent and score by dribbling a ball through either of the small goals.  These 1v1 competitions are excellent technique and conditioning practice  and a staple of our programs. Fakes, feints, step-overs, changes of direction, they're all there."
