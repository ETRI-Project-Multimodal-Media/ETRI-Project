  "transcription": " Good afternoon. We are the faculty of Kratingsarn University, Manatee State and my friend. We would like to ask you a few questions about the current industry. We will take a video of the interview from our meeting.  Okay, what is your name? How did you become interested in tourism industry?  I would like to share the information about our culture, our history of Thailand. And so it should be good to have the local guide to guide life and give the information for the foreigner who come and travel in here, in this country. Because of they should know what they should do and should don't. They should know and should understand about the background of the history of us.  How did you start your university at Apocalypse?  5 years ago I took the course from Chiang Mai University about to be a tour guide license. This is my tour guide license. Yes. And then so I really love this job because I know a lot of information and history and everything about all of my country. And so go to the university and then they have the course to you can become the local guide.  What do you like best about your job? The most that I love the best for my job, I love to see people smile and happy and then learn about our culture. Indeed, because sometimes they don't understand why we do like this, our culture, why we respect the religion, why we love the king or something like that. Thank you very much.  Yes, thank you so much for talking to me."
