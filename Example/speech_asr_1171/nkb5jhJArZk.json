  "transcription": " We were walking along the street and we saw the windows. Through the windows you could see down into the basement a long way. We thought that's interesting. We saw a sign as to where the entrance was. Purely by accident we came across it.  There were castles. I didn't know that there was a whole road underneath the Royal Palace, that there was an old palace underneath the new Royal Palace. There's like a whole world underground which I didn't know about, which I discovered in this museum. So that was really interesting.  I didn't know it was so big. And this big palace, no one can guess what was here and what was burned. It's interesting. First, the existence of the palace. I didn't know there was a palace here. I had no idea that there was so much there, I suppose. Because I didn't realize that was there and it was a total surprise to see it. It's nice. I don't know.  you"
