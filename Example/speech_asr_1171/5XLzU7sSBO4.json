  "transcription": " If you've ever wondered why so many forex traders get trapped in weak positions on the wrong side of the market, the reason is very simple. Because this is when the market makers are at their most active, driving a currency pair rapidly in one direction  before reversing the direction just as quickly. Traders are then left stranded, having initially chased the price on the fear of missing out, only to be left stranded in a weak position or stopped out and regretting this hasty decision. So what's the solution? And here again it's very simple, as this is where the quantum volatility indicator steps in. The quantum dynamic volatility indicator  signals this volatility in real time as a candle or price bar is forming. The indicator does this by constantly scanning the price action for extremes and any move outside the average true range. When this condition is met, it's signalled on the MT5 chart with a purple dot which appears above and below the candle. But this happens in real time and before the candle has closed.  help traders? Well, again the answer is very simple, as what often occurs after such a move is the price action then reverses to trade back inside the spread of the candle or bar, and those traders trapped in weak positions are squeezed emotionally and eventually close positions at a loss. Volatility is generally a trap move, which is why price action reverses. So as soon as the signal is  Once the price action has moved away from this region sometime later, then it's safe to consider entering the market once more. But if you already have a position and the volatility indicator is triggered, you have a decision to make. But at least you can anticipate the price action and the volatility indicator.  anticipate what is likely to happen next and plan accordingly. Based on the hugely popular MT4 version of the indicator, we've added some new and exciting features for the MT5 release. Now you have complete control over the sensitivity of the indicator, so you can choose whether to increase or decrease this, in other words, whether you want to see more signals or fewer. Also included is a new alerts option  which signals when the indicator has been triggered and confirmed with a push notification to your mobile so you never miss another volatility signal when you're on the go. Volatility can seriously damage your wealth, but by investing in the Quantum Dynamic Volatility Indicator now, you can save both emotional and financial pain. So it makes sense to add this indicator to your toolkit of leading-edge indicators today.  Thank you."
