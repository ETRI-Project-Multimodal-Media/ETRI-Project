  "transcription": " Kuttanadan Marppappa  Adithya Ravi is the heroine. Ajju Varghese, Innocente, Salim Kumar, Ramesh Pisharadi, Dharmajan Bolgatti, Teeny Tom, Harish Karnaran, VK Prakash, Mallikasu Kumaran are the other main characters.  Shanti Krishna  The film is a combination of the chemistry between the two. When Dharmajan and his counter are in the makeover, it is a great film. The location of Kuttanad and Kunjako Bhopan is a great addition to the colourful film. These roles are now more difficult to play in Malayalam than in any other language. Ammachi Mary's role is a bit difficult to play, but Shanthi Krishna is fresh.  I am happy to see a long-term role like this opposite the hero. Selim Kumar is coming out of the Philippines with his old-fashioned style. Dharmajan Ajoubargis, Harish Kanaran, Saobin, there is nothing to say about them."
