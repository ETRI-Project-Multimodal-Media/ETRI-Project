  "transcription": " Hey, sister! How does it feel to have a license? Okay, what is this? Why? I'm so good to you! This is no good! I wouldn't know. I failed. Oh, shit! Now my O's mean $20 if we make you feel real hot. It's okay. I'll get you eliminated some Sour Patch Kids. You'll pass next time. We'll practice.  Thanks Josh, that was some good brain work. Uh, Chia, you gotta help me get with Josh. I like him. Oh, but do you think that he likes you? Well, yeah. Well, do you really think that you could go with Josh? He's a great guy. Uh, well, I'm just some dumbface stupid head. No! So I'm just not good enough with Josh or something? Well, you are from New Jersey.  Why do I even listen to you? To be innocent? You're a virgin who can't drop! That was way worse than I expected.  I am Albie.  I miss you  I only hear what I want to, I don't listen hard. Don't pay attention to the music that you're running. Don't wait for an ending where I don't understand. If you really care, I'll hold it here and then. No, no, no, no, no, no. Bring your heart and bring your love. This world is singing my song. Love is in the moment, love is on the move. Love is mine, the other won't say.  Oh my god I love Josh  Thank you."
