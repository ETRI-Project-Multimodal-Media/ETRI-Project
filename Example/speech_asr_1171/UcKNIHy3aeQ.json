But every day's a holiday when I'm near to you. There were lights on my tree,  I wish you could see I wish it every day Clouds on the far fill me with desire To see you and to say That I wish you a Merry Christmas  I wish  I wish you a Merry Christmas Happy New Year to I have just one wish on this Christmas Eve I wish I were with you  I wish I were with you Merry Christmas, darling"
