It's possible this pet shop and they always have the puppies It's freezing because it's near the beach and also  Here is because of the beautiful light, because they light up everything at night around Christmas. So it's nice to walk around here and take some nice pictures.  restaurants around both sides of the road. Of course, during the summertime, it's busy, busy, busy. And now it's winter. So there are more lights all the way to the beach. And even the shops around here also are very  colorful. The cold actually makes me very hungry and what is the best thing to have in this cold weather? This is the famous Hainan Day market. Let's just see what food they have.  These are the blind eels. I had it when I first came to Buzkan many years ago. The eels are very famous dish around here, but it's a bit fishy taste for me.  A nice Korean steamed bun and also dumplings. I'm gonna have the Hong Kong pancake. It's 1,000 won.  This hot pancake is slightly different here in Busan. They actually put some nuts in it. Sometimes it's cheaper to eat out than to cook.  Oh, these are the different shrimps. Where are people going to the beach at night in winter? I don't know. Let's go and find out.  I'm now on Haeundae beach. Looks like a lot of people are walking on the sidewalk but not really on the beach.  beautiful scenery though  This is my ice dessert. I just ordered.  It's nice and cold. Yummy. Yummy. I miss this."
