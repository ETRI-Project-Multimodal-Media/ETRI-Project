  "transcription": " Hi everybody, this is FoxNomad and today I want to help you travel smarter  I figured under those conditions there were no people around, it's quite windy I figured if I could fly here, I could fly anywhere But at that time I wasn't as confident to fly up in the highlands as I am now after two years of really flying a drone on a regular basis So I spent a lot of time up there over the last few days trying to get as many drone shots as I could The weather was very difficult to work with, it was rainy and gusty which is pretty typical up there Okay so, I'm in the highlands right now  I was gonna throw but it's pretty rainy and super windy and I don't want to crash it here.  hit the like and subscribe buttons.

Bye!  so  so  so  so  so  so  so  I've been in your world  It's one way or the other  so  I know I'm damn for sure I've never been so close before It's one way or the other I can't stay forever dreaming  So  You  you"
