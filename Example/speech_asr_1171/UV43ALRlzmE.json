  "transcription": " This is PRE's cut to length for making drive cleats and S standing cleats. We've combined some of our common components, a P20 HD servo with a pull-through straightener, bowtie,  die for cropping the two ends, which can be interchanged with a straight cut off, 10 foot conveyor going down into a roll former. The machine can do from 8 inch drive cleats up to 10 foot conveyor  long, standing S cleats the same. You can adjust the width of the conveyor through the guide system so the material comes down and is funneled into the roll former for feeding straight. You have job storage in the unit. Jog, fold, and reverse, E-style  This will run with a motorized stock rail for continuous operation.  so  so"
