Three days, we're seeing Emma, our daughter again and we're going to do some more sightseeing starting with this afternoon It's cold!  We don't normally come this part of London do we? We're going to walk down there towards Westminster. We've got a Bankman tour pass first. You've got the London Eye over there.  to go to the top. We've never done that so perhaps we'll have to do that sometime. That's for sure. Yes.  Isn't this great? A whole cycle lane for cyclists. Fantastic. So many more people would cycle if it was safe to do so. This is just purely for people on two wheels. Or one wheel. We've got a unicycle.  Right we're heading towards it, the curse is upon us The curse of Stratholme So the Elizabeth Tower is undergoing essential conservation work it's by 2021  It may be done.  and they're interviewing politicians because you've got Parliament behind us and they're either in the boxes there or on the grass here normally getting heckled by the general public  She's gone ahead of me again. I'll catch up. We're now in St James's Park which leads into Buckingham Palace. So we're going to walk through the park and have a quick look at the palace. Say hello to the Queen.  Just over there is Buckingham Palace. This is why we like St James' Park so much. It's in slap bang in the centre of London, right next to Buckingham Palace. And considering we are in London, this park is lovely. So we're at the other end of St James' Park. Just over here is Buckingham Palace.  in a palace.  Yes, not our hotel tonight. Shame. We're at Somerset House. We were here in December when they had the ice skater rink set up.  It's amazing how different it can look after just one month. No ice skating? All gone?  🎵"
