I need somebody who can take control I know exactly what I need to do  I don't wanna be alone tonight, alone tonight Look what you made me do I'm somebody new Ooh baby, baby I'm dancing with a stranger Look what you made me do I'm somebody new Ooh baby, baby I'm dancing with a stranger Oh I'm dancing with a stranger I'm dancing with a stranger  Dancing with a stranger. Dancing with a stranger."
