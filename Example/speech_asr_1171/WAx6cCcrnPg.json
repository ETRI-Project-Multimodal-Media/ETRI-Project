  "transcription": " In 1982, I formed Soccer Plus to provide opportunities for youth soccer players to realize their potential, to receive the very best coaching, and to develop confidence, commitment, and life skills on and off the field. First and foremost, I set out to develop Soccer Plus as an education company. My background was in education.  SoccerPlus has four business entities serving youth soccer.  competing in top flight competition in New England and national competitions. In 2008 we formed a new entity focusing on assisting town soccer organisations implement changes that will raise the performance of players, coaches and administrators. We call our mission the Player Development Revolution. The SoccerPlus brand and the name DiCicco is synonymous with excellence and achievement. Tony's unprecedented  coaching success in soccer with the US national team winning three world championships affords Tony the moniker of the USA's most successful soccer coach. Probably Tony's most important achievements however are raising the expectations and performance of thousands of players, coaches and parents every year through Soccer Plus.  at all levels of the game and in life. For more information on how Soccer Plus can help you and your program, please contact Dave Newberry, our Director of Player and Coach Development."
