  "transcription": " Hello everyone, Assalamu Alaikum. This is Abdulaziz and it's not a vlog.  I want to share a treasure hidden in Kohat. This is not a vlog in my language. This is just a family's program. We are here at Chilli Bagh. It is near to Hangul Society.  so  So I showed you the shots and this was Chiliba This is a new beautiful small valley of Kohat There are mountains around, they are dry but there is a beautiful place here You can come here with your family  Occasionally, whatever the function is, come here, party, enjoy, cook meat, barbecue and enjoy the sound of this water. We are enjoying with our little Maashi. So Maashi, what would you say about this? She is worried about what to do. So this vlog ends here and we didn't say anything.  because we are in Guwahati and the people here are very talented so if they say something, they will point out our mistakes so lets end this video here Allah Hafiz"
