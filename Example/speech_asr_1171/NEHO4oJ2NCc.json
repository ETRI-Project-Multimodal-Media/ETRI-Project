If I could work my will, every idiot who goes about with Merry Christmas on his lips should be boiled in his own pudding and buried with a stake of holly through his heart.  You will be visited by three spirits. Expect the first tomorrow when the bell tolls one. What brings you here? Your welfare, of course.  Dear brother going home Far away from this dreary place of solitude For this heart's change of heart From now on, you're gonna be part of every Christmas at home  Come my dears and gather round, Hot to strain the joyful sound. Grab your partners small or big, Skip to the beat of a fancy big jig.  Who are you I am the ghost of Christmas present  of the spirit of Christmas yet to come.  as an angel. I'm as merry as a schoolboy. And so, as Tiny Tim observed, God bless our lovely boy!  you"
