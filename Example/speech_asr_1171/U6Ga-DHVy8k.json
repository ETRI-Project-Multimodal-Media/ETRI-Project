  "transcription": " There was a huge blockbuster in Tamil called Darling. It was a horror movie. Are you scared of horror movies? Yes, I am. I don't go to the theatre to watch horror movies. My friends torture me, blackmail me and force me to go to the theatre. I sit like this. You must have been sitting on a chair.  Why would you tease your friends just because you want to? He was the one who made everyone scared of Darling. No, I only scared 4 artists. Only the artists who acted with us in the film got scared. But the audience didn't find the film and that's comedy. So the audience didn't get scared. But it's a horror. That's comedy horror.  you"
