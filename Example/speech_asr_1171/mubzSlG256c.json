  "transcription": " Hi, my name is Marjorie Mayfair, and I'm a vintage enthusiast from Melbourne. We're here at Leah S. Designs, and we'll be focusing on the plus-size perfection range and showing you how to bring a vintage vibe to your wedding day. To bustle or not to bustle? That is the question on every bride's mind. It's not that difficult. Basically, all we have to do is find the loop,  and bring it up and attach it to the back of the dress. Now she's ready. She can walk around with ease. No one has to stand on it like Uncle Barry after a beverage or two. She's free to roam. She's free to dance. And she's free to have a good time too."
