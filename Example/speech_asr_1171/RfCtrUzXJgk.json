  "transcription": " Hey gang, hope you guys all had a really good Christmas and New Years. I know I did, very relaxing. Didn't do a whole lot, family came over, ate lots of food. But it is time to get back on the grind and today I am going to go hit the car wash and then we got a car meet to go to.  My club is putting it on. If you don't know what my club is, it's called Insurge. Insurge Army on Instagram. I'll put the description, the link in the description. Just a car club here in NNY, small group. Just started over the summer of 2018. But, you know, should be a pretty good meet.  Not a lot of meats here during the winter just because most people put their cars away but Subaru life so usually a lot of subs there. It's at Panera Bread. But yeah so I will probably do a quick video at the car wash and then I will do some video at the meet.  Yeah  Oh you got it all.  I want to, I mean this girl  I already ate and stuff  It's so cute  I have a 500 drain plug I got I got a 502, I got a 800 hex drain plug and then I got a 511, that's a 21mm socket drain plug  I do want his brake calipers though. Yeah, they're nice. I kind of want to find out where he bought them from because it's literally just like rock auto.  of the salt and all that. I don't drive mine a lot, I drive the daily a lot. But it was a pretty good turnout. Shout out to my boy Keegan about your car. It looks like a fuel line leak. It just dumped everywhere. It was actually the first time he brought the car to a meet so it really sucks but we'll get it back on the road. We'll fix that. Anything else that happens to it. I hope you guys had a good new year and I hope you settled in.  set some goals for this year and look back on them at the end of the year. That's what I like to do and see what I reached. Hopefully, a lot of people use it as a fresh start. Just good luck with everything and I will see you guys in the next video."
