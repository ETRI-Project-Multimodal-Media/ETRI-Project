I'm the affluent Ebeneezer to be honest, just scrooge.  You may be mean for a Shrek, but you'll see I'm getting meaner And I'll bitch slap your splish black with a grumpy demeanor I'll give you all ice cold whipping since you're a wither shit You're making me sick in a tiny tip, but however, I quit!  You naughty kiddies better watch out, cause Kris Kringle's on the screw!  I've been pissin' since I kissed all of your mothers You've been roasted like chestnuts with my burning coal rocks Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night  Thanks for watching!"
