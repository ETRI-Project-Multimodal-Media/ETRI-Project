Heavy, if the tofu is food, then maybe it's like a hard cheese. I've been wanting to sense that kind of difference by visiting there.  the opposite situation is happening. The small buildings are leading the new trend of architectural history. In that sense, the Japanese architecture and the Swiss architecture, both are leading the new trend. Many Japanese actually admire the Swiss architects, maybe because of the philosophy and then also because of the way they do things. And then one more thing I think is the degree of precision in the construction of things.  Swiss watches, it's very precise, well put together and then it delivers very well. And I think that it's something that is shared by the Japanese and then the Swiss. So this high level of craftsmanship, the precision in doing things is something that they both share."
