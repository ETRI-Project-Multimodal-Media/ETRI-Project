  "transcription": " The Lennon Wall is a symbol of courage. Just a few decades ago, it was a place where people shared their dreams and wishes despite a lack of freedom behind the Iron Curtain. Courage and freedom is what I need to create. Without them, I could never have become a street artist. After college, I decided to try to make a living as an artist. It turned out to be the best decision.  The bridge moves you forward. The hand stands for an idea. And the pen is a tool of creation. Stand up and speak up. As a photographer, I always try to capture a unique moment.  The atmosphere directly motivates a courageous step. It's safe to stay in one place, but life is worth the risk. Also, the car says it by its name. Scala, as the Latin word for ladder, will help you to achieve more. Quite simply, courage moves you forward.  ŠKODA. Simply clever."
