  "transcription": " From FXEmpires, Christopher Lewis looking at the pound-dollar and you can see that we have rallied a bit during the trading session on Wednesday as we await the Federal Reserve statement. The 133 and a third level is an area that has been important for some time and I think it makes sense that we're just hanging  out here trying to figure out where to go next as we await the statement. If we can break above 1.34 we go to 1.35 and then 1.3650 and I do think that we're trying to form some type of rounded bottom in the British pound. But if the Federal Reserve is more dovish than anticipated that could turbocharges move. Alternately though if they're overly aggressive then we could drop to the 1.31 handle. Longer term though I do think that the pound bounces back in 2018.  you"
