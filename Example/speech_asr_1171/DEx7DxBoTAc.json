  "transcription": " Today was a great day with beautiful conditions and I was really just excited about how the team ran. We have some awesome underclass who really stepped up and showed some great teamwork today.  Everyone was really supportive of each other. So it was an awesome day, awesome race. We did pretty well today. We came in about 40 seconds faster than we wanted to on the top guys. The good thing was it was both 1 and 2. Kevin Murray and Jake Ropey were both sophomores. So we've got a good season ahead of us I think. It's nice to be done but at the same time it's kind of surreal. You know everything I do this year and the rest of the first-tier team, it's the last time that they'll ever do it. So it's kind of surreal but at the same time it's a good feeling just getting one step closer to our goal of nationals. I love this course. It's really fun.  It's really challenging, it's a very difficult course but fun every time. We've got our hill in the back, we've got a fast first mile so we'll definitely miss it. I think our big goal, I mean obviously we always want to beat Army, but then our big goal we really look to is we're trying to make it go back to Nationals this year so it's going to be a tough competition in the region again this year so hopefully we can get back there for another time back to back. Just more team oriented goals, just keeping everyone in a really positive mindset, keeping everyone working together moving forward. We've got amazing talent and we both have amazing work ethic.  So, you know, we just want to keep moving up."
