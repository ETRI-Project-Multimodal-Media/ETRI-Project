They fly Nillilick and Vulcan. Are there any funny bits? Yes. Where R2D2, where the new robot says...  That was really funny! That didn't happen! It did! What did he say then Pops? What? I don't know. That isn't true! Do you think it's too scary for kiddies? No! Are there any sad bits in the film?  Yeah. What? Kylo Ren pushed Han Solo and he died. No he didn't push him. What happened? The lightsaber touched him. Who was your favourite character in the new Star Wars film? It was BB-8. BB-8 why? Because he fits R2. He weighed R2.  He raped R2. And if you were to be one person in the new Star Wars film, who would you be? I would be Luke. I would be Princess Leia. How about Rey? Oh yes, Rey. Or Princess Leia. I decided both of them. Even though Princess Leia's a bit older now? Yeah.  Out of 10 what would you give the new Star Wars film? 100 million thousand out of 10.  Stop bullying Kylo Ren  Bye!"
