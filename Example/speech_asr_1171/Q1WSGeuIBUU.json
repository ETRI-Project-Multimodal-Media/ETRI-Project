  "transcription": " A really fun memory was one time in class, a student, Bridget, was laughing for no reason. And after that, all the kids just started laughing. I think that was really fun, and I just love working with them.  Bridget always inspires me when she shows up  has her helmet on and has her team shirt on with all of our names on it. She just always knows when to make noise in the dugout and she's always just there around to cheer us on.  Take it all in, take it all in, no life is a big lesson. We all believe in you, that you'll make it through. Don't live in the past, do not dream of the future. Today is your day, and this is your moment.  He always motivates us, always keeps us in the game. When you see him, you just kind of want to give an extra effort because he's always there, always smiling. He has a huge impact on our football team. When I see people as happy as they are to see Morgan and how great she is on our cheer team,  She's a great asset to us. She really helps us out. I feel we're all much nicer in understanding. It makes me feel so much better that our school includes so many kids.  I look up to you more than you know I can't stand seeing you go I love you so much Take it all in, take it all in No laugh is a big lesson We all believe in you  you that you're making through don't live in the past do not dream of the future today's your day and this is your moment your moment  Oh yeah"
