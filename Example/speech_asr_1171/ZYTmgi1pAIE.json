  "transcription": " Hey everybody, how you doing? Happy Holidays! It's Junkyard here. We have a Junkyard Quickie that went up. It's Saturday. So primarily the question was for today is, how you doing? So how are you doing? Make sure you leave that comment and answer that question to the Junkyard Quickie video that's over on Machinima Reson. But for me to answer that, well, I'm doing pretty good. You know, things are looking up.  Like I said, if you haven't already known already, I got a job so that's doing pretty good. Today we already had a one Christmas gathering where I stuffed myself with the Cheesecake Factory which was oh so good. And then we got another Fiesta tonight. So primarily, I can't complain. So again, if you want to go ahead and have me use one of your quickie questions, leave a Junkyard Quickie question down below. Go QQ with your question. Make sure it's a question for everybody, not just for me. And maybe I'll use your question.  a question on the next Junkyard Quickie. Well this was short and sweet, got it going, got a party to go to. Thanks a lot and as always, needless to say, keep gaming."
