  "transcription": " First thing, off the song.  Black water here is wet and dry So much like what you see So much like what you see Cause we've been waiting for you Come here to this place To have a new experience Not for us, but for you So say you've been waiting for me I see you, I see you, say you  Oh  Oh  Oh  From this life, this is how I want you to walk along. Run away from here, I've got nothing against you, but surely I'll miss you. This place is full of fish, and I hope you'll mind, take a breath inside. We'll figure it out.  No one's back home alright, there's been all the news I pray that at least I've got to get somebody to listen  You are yet so confident I'm so dead on in this disease They can't scratch or change me I need another chance to live  So  I don't know you, think I'm a liar Scared of your deception I'm just a zombie  I'm too far and I'm far away from you Can I beat against you? Tell me I'm missing you This place is full of fish like you And I hate you, man, so give me a sign Come and let me dry  you"
