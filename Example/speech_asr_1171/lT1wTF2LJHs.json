  "transcription": " Ruthless, focused and emphatic. Bayern are back to their bar-raising best. In for Lewandowski, dummied here for Thomas Müller! Lewandowski's in there, and there it is! Now 11 home games he's scored in equals that of Jupp Heynckes, set for Gladbach in the 72-73 season. Müller!  What a finish! What a finish! An angle which seemed prohibitive. When you're Thomas Muller, there is no such thing as prohibitive. What a one-of-a-kind goal for Bayern. Bayern, through Thomas Muller's goal, win this one by two goals to one.  you"
