  "transcription": " I am so bored and nobody wants to go shopping with me. Nobody wants to make slime with me. There's really nothing I can possibly do except play with weird Silas. I mean, he's the weirdest person on earth, but sadly our only option. Here goes nothing. Silas, what do you want to play today? Silas!  What do you want to play? We're going to make blender people and pop the pimples. One by one by one by one. Okay, let's go.  Mwahahahaha! Mwahahahaha! First I form the head. Then I form the body. Like that. Then the arms. Hold up, jump into a snake. Push it onto the body. Then make the legs. One right there. And one right there.  Discovery  Nyeh! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha!"
