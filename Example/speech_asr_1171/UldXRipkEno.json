And every day of my life, I have a combat, one that makes me sweat and one that makes me rewarded. My goal's in life, and that's where I want to be. I want to be a champion. I live for performance, and I'm made to play outside. I have to surround myself with elements that give me confidence, physically and mentally.  I earned it, and I know what it takes to be at the top of the game. Racing is everything to me. It's the only thing I love. It's in my blood, and it's in my family genetics.
