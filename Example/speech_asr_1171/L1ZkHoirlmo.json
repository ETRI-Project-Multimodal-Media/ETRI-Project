  "transcription": " The cross cradle. The cross cradle position is great for newborns learning to latch on correctly as it allows you greater control. Your baby's body should be placed across the front of your body. One arm should run the length of your baby's back with your hand supporting their head and neck but allowing your baby's head to be free to move. You can encourage your baby to open their mouth wide to latch on by gently tickling their lip with your nipples.  You may find it more comfortable to use a breastfeeding pillow for extra support."
