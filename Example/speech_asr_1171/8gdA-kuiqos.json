I know you think you're the queen of the underground But you can't send me dead flowers every morning Send me dead flowers by the mail Send me dead flowers to my wedding And I won't forget to put a ring on it  Nick Storack!  Take me down, little Susie, take me down I know you think you're the queen of the underground But you can't send me death flowers every morning Send me death flowers by the morning Send me death flowers  Next door  Take me down, little Susie, take me down I know you think you're the queen of the underground Well you can't send me death powers every morning Send me death powers by the U.S.A.  Send me ten flowers to my wedding And I won't forget to put roses on your grave No, I won't forget to put roses on your grave  Good night!"
