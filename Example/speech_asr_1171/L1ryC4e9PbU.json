  "transcription": " Welcome to the Shell Dual Drive. So it's often said in Formula One that partnerships and great teamwork is absolutely essential. It's a glorious day here in Spa. We've got two very special guests. I've got a very special challenge for you today. Two runs of this simple slalom course. But little Alfa Romeo has got dual controls. So one of you is going to do the steering, throttle and gear lever, while the other does the clutch and the brakes. Are you up for it?  Clutch you have? Yeah. Yeah, I was worried about this camera. Brake, brake. That's it. I show you how to start without clutch. Like this.  Look. So far you are just passive. Exactly. But nobody said that women's log is a handbrake. You are a log, he said. No, it's a handbrake. Okay, clutch. Wait, wait, wait. Hey, no clutch. It's not turning very well. Don't turn, man. That's too easy. Perfect.  Did I get the driving licence? You passed. Thank you."
