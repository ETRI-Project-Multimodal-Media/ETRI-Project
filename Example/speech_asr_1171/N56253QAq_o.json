  "transcription": " Yeah! Go back to the baby!  Tonight I'm standing on a broken promise I'm leaning into you still hoping that I won't fall Tonight I'm staring at a picture of this A captured memory of a girl who had it all It's Friday night, quarter after two  I've been waiting for something new I'm still waiting Here's us in the shadow of the same wall Another chance to end it all We'll burn Monday into ashes Next time I'll make the same mistake This photograph can't be replaced And I still see the flashes Tonight I don't wanna go back home I just wanna be alone Tonight A sky full of stars that an ocean can't divide  I hope you won't forget this lie Photograph has shown I'm not here alone It's just another tragic story of my life Just another tragic story of my life Tonight these photographs are out of focus Adjust the aperture, reveal a painful truth  Planet X in the air since 1995"
