  "transcription": " During Paris Fashion Week, Chaumet decided to present its new collection of high jewelry, the first design by artistic director Claire Devey. The house, owned by LVMH, has founded its trademark flower, the Hortensia, which blossoms on 24 unique pieces in three different colors, powder pink, blue and red.  Chaumet has always had flowers, but it has never had its own flower like other houses, who have their own iconic flower. We wanted to choose one and to work that throughout the collection. There are 90 variations of the Hortensia, and what's extraordinary about the flower is its variety of colors and its variety of shapes, and the way in which the flowers are sometimes hung effectively.  So it's a flower which can be really manipulated, which can be very soft like the powder pink theme in the collection, or much more modern like when it is colored blue, decorated with diamonds, with lapis lazuli which is more structured. What we wanted to see initially was the universe of the flower and to feel its delicacy across all the jewelry, which moves and is articulated and subtle, and there is a real lightness to it also.  Clients are becoming predominantly female clients. In the world today, there is an emergence of the female buyer. That is to say, women who buy things for themselves and indulge themselves. So inevitably, like with fashion, this forces a creativity, a sensibility which is more feminine. And Claire Devey knew exactly how to capture that.  you"
