  "transcription": " When my primary physician informed me that I was diabetic, I started getting really worried about amputations and all the things that go along with being diabetic. So I would really watch my legs and stuff like that. And if there was a sore, I'd hop on it and try and treat it and stuff. And I noticed that the sores didn't used to close right, and now they actually develop a proper scab  and they go away if I bump my leg into something. And now I don't get them spontaneously anymore due to the swelling in the leg. So I haven't been getting it anymore. Now my cat has contributed to a few wounds, but luckily they heal quickly enough. And the pain in my legs was tremendous. If I bump my legs into anything, it was a pretty nightmarish scenario and a lot of gritting of teeth going on.  And now that's improved, I'd say 20-fold. It's very, very nice."
