  "transcription": " Frances doesn't mind driving 30 minutes once a week to get her allergy shots. It's a small price to pay for someone who says she was a prisoner in her own home.  I'd always wind up with sinus infection and then have to go to the doctor and be on antibiotics. The sneezing was very, very bad. Coughing just fits. And then it would just be so... It would go into the sinus infection and then, of course, the headaches, bad, bad headaches.  And everybody told me you won't notice the difference for several months, but I did. The first month I began to feel a little bit better and could tell that it was really helping me. Like most allergy patients, Frances' program started with twice a week treatments, then once a week, and eventually once a month. And now when they cut the hay? I didn't have a problem with it. It happened, they cut it about three weeks ago. Didn't bother me at all. I can get out and sweep off my own sidewalk.  and I can get out and at least get in and out of my car without being affected. By this time in the year I would have been on antibiotics at least three times and I haven't had to. The best part is after two years of treatment, Frances will drive away completely allergy free. I haven't had a single sinus infection since I started this shots, not one. It's amazing.  you"
