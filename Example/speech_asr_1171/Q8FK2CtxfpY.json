Let's draw together!  1  1 White White  White White  Crashing through the snow In a one horse open sleigh O'er the fields we go Laughing all the way Bells on bobtails ring Making spirits bright What fun it is to laugh And sing this sleighing song tonight  Jingle bells, jingle all the way Oh what fun it is to ride In a one horse open sleigh Now that you know the rhyme, let's sing along.  So  red red red  RED  so  Dashing through the snow In a one horse open sleigh O'er the fields we go Laughing all the way Bells on bobtails ring Making spirits bright What fun it is to laugh And sing this sleighing song tonight  Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way. Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh. Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way. Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh. A day or two ago, I thought I'd take a ride. And soon Miss Fanny Bright,  The horse was lean and lame, His fortune seemed his lot, We got into a drifted bank, And then we got upsot.  Red Red  Now that you know the rhyme, let's sing along.  Mm.  English color kids calm  So gather round, they'll stake your claim And see who gets the hat, that, that!"
