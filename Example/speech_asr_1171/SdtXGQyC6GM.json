  "transcription": " Today is Saturday and I've been here almost a month now. The country around here is real hilly. We're sort of in a valley down close to, well you might say close to the Bay of Tompkins, I think it is.  And at night, you can lay in your bed and listen to the gun shoot from out, the Navy shoots in. Once in a while, they have some small arms fire in here, but not very much. Usually it's just the big cannons off way up towards the north. Of course, they had an alert last night, which they called out all the base defense. And they thought we were gonna get hit last night, but I think they wiped them out before they got set up real good.  They're all the time trying to set up missile sites around here and we spot them before they get them set up too well usually and knock them out, you know, before they even fire a first missile. But once in a while they'll get in a good place, you know, and get hid and set up a missile range and everything and fire in on us. But as long as I'm in the bunker or in the tents, even in the tents as you'll notice they got sandbags around the side of the tent. And as long as you're behind something and down low,  sandbags will take up all the shrapnel and all and you don't have to worry about it too much. We've kind of kept Charlie down lately. Charlie is what we call VC. They do a lot of firing from Happy Valley which is right below Tent City and usually they're either trying to hit the planes you know that go out and do all this bombing and all or either they're after this radar screen that we've got up here you know of course we can hold them off there too because these  I reckon there's at least 411,000, 100,000 men around this base before they get to us. And of course there's not too many down around behind Tent City here, but of course the Vietnamese have all kind of a set up stand here and the Vietnamese pretty well take care of them."
