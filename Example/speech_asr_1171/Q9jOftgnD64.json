This is a beautiful big family home. We have a formal lounge and a secondary lounge as well.  I think the best thing about this house is the open plan living dining room at the back. You get to see right through to the pool. There are four bedrooms here. A master bedroom with either a huge walk-in robe or study, or you can make that into the fourth bedroom. We've got a west-facing and north-facing courtyard, gardens,  with a citrus orchard. There are orange trees, lime trees, we have olive trees. It's just amazing. The gardens are really low maintenance. We have paved areas and overlooking a beautiful in-ground pool. The location here is amazing. We've got just down the road the local Italian cafe, which makes apparently the best coffee in Sandringham. We have the beach about a kilometre away, bus stops, transport,  and schools all around the area. It is really a great location. You really have to come and see this home. I look forward to seeing you at one of our open for inspections."
