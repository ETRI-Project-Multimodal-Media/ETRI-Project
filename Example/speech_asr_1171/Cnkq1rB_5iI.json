I'm probably only 50 yards away, but I'm right up against a big oak tree, which is behind me. So, when I set the blind up last night, there were about three deer out there in a field. It's about 70 degrees right now, chance of rain today.  So, I met my father-in-law's place. He said he don't see too many deer during the morning, but in the evening, he's counted sometimes 20, 30 deer a night. But, it's an area surrounded by private property.  And I guess the other owners, property owners around here were out shooting, sighting their guns in and stuff and he said it kind of scared the deer away during the day so he hasn't seen too many yesterday. But, only one nice sized doe to pop out. I'll keep waiting.  Okay.  Okay.  you  I  I  It's only the fourth shot I heard so not much happening this morning.  Okay.  Ah!  September 17th. It's about 8 minutes to 6 o'clock. Totally expecting to see some deer tonight. It's warm. It's like 78 degrees.  degrees  Then I'm gonna stick inside the body cavity to help cool the deer down faster. It's supposed to be like 58 or something tonight, so not cool cool, but a lot better than 78. So, we'll see how things go and hopefully we'll see some deer here in a little bit.  Here's our first customer of the night. Nice sized doe with a little smaller one it looks like. Oh, there's the big one. Couple smaller ones. So I'm going to get ready. As soon as she pops out I'm going to take a shot.  Got the big one. That's a little one right there. I'm not going to shoot that little guy.  you"
