  "transcription": " 1961 Humber Super Snipe Series 3 charging up one of Dunedin's varied hills still in top gear at this stage not bad for a 56 years old a little bit of wind noise unfortunately could do with some sound deadening knowing I haven't got round to it yet but very nice cruises out very well  Nothing like a bit of wood grain in an old English car. Let's see if there's anybody exciting out the back. No one. Looking good though.  A series of corners coming up now, no worry either."
