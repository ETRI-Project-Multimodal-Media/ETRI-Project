  "transcription": " Greetings and thank you for your interest in the William Penn Fellowship. Long before I was governor, I made the decision to take two years off from college in order to join the Peace Corps. They sent me to a small village in India where I helped teach local farmers how to grow more food for their community. I volunteered because I wanted to experience new things. I wanted to challenge myself. Most importantly, I wanted to do something to improve the lives of the people.  other people. These are the values that underscore the William Penn Fellowship, a first-of-its-kind program for Pennsylvania State Government. Our goal with the William Penn Fellowship is to attract the best and brightest minds to help solve real-world challenges affecting the lives of Pennsylvanians. As a Fellow, you'll have the opportunity to work alongside leaders and decision-makers across state government to improve programs and services, develop innovative solutions to complex issues, and better serve the people of Pennsylvania.  My two years in the Peace Corps were an incredibly meaningful and transformative time in my life, and it's my hope that the William Penn Fellowship has the same lasting impact on the next generation of public servants. I hope you'll consider applying to become a William Penn Fellow. Thank you."
