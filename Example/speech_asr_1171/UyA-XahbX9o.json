  "transcription": " Promotions in association with the American Boxing Federation.  Nice and, you know, straightforward. Not the fastest fighter. Got a nice, straight jab. So far, a pretty evenly matched fight. Nice jab from Moran. Looking for the... looking to land that big right hand. Pretty good reasons, man, where we have Rodriguez is keeping that left hand down. Yeah, that jab's very, very good. He needs to keep that flowing. Yeah, that just clasps his head.  Nice right hand to the body. Rodriguez needs to do a bit more. He's got to follow that jab as he's moving also. Oh, right on the temple, right on the temple. Right hand over the top. He's looking for that shot from the bell ring. That was a nice right hand. Yeah, right on the temple. He's surprised he can make such a move.  He's looking for the kill now, for sure. Nice jab by Benny. Keep it smart, off the jab. Moran's fighting very smart, keeping his hands high. Still moving forward, looking for the kill. Not trying to make too many mistakes. Nice right hand again to the left jab. He walked in a little bit.  He's got a little bit of a walk into a right hand himself there. Oh, nice hook right on the chin. Wow, nice shot. That was a lovely shot. Nice little hook. His leg left him just... This might be it. I don't know. No, he doesn't want to get up. That's it. That's over. Oh, nice there. Nice little pro debut win. Get the butterflies out. No? I don't think Rodriguez had the heart. No, I don't. You know, great fight.  That's why you got hit with the right hand over the top from Rodriguez. That was probably Rodriguez's best punt. Yeah. Ladies and gentlemen, from the St. Pete Coliseum in St. Pete, Florida, your referee in charge, Massimo Montanini, calls a halt to this bout and reaches the count of 10 at two minutes, one second of the first round. Your winner by knockout, now 1-0 as a professional, Armando Morales.  RUN!"
