A revolution representing  and advanced technology in artificial grass industry. With the accelerating development of the artificial grass industry, we are now facing a new challenge, how to dispose the end of life turf. Nowadays, approximately 500 football fields are disposed each year globally. While such figure keeps rising, the disposal of artificial grass  becomes a top issue. Regular products use latex or PU as coating materials. It makes the disposal complicated and costly. The recyclability is very limited. CC Grass PRT Series can be 100% recycled. No coating, no latex, no PU. The PRT Series not only makes a positive impact on the environment, it is also more friendly to your families.  PRT Series is specially designed with no coating. It allows water to drain through hole backing evenly and quickly. Regular products with latex or PU coating have to drain off through drainage holes. It is normally hard to permeate through latex or PU materials, so it can result in water logging on the surface. Water permeability of PRT Series  is five times quicker than the regular products. The special technique used in production brings strong tough lock to CC Grass PRT Series products. Compared with regular ones, the tuft of PRT Series are more adhesive to the backing. PRT Series is applicable for intensive use, with a longer service life, and is perfect in keeping its shape.  CC Grass PRT Series demonstrates its better quality with more benefits.
