  "transcription": " I invite you to know, love, and serve Christ through the Jesuits. My name is Nico Lariosa and I am a Jesuit in France.  Ritchie Fernando was a Filipino Jesuit missionary in Cambodia. He was working as a teacher and chaplain at a technical school run by the Jesuits, mainly offering pastoral support, spiritual support to victims of landmine and polio. Ritchie died protecting the life of his students from a disgruntled young man who wanted to hurl a hand grenade into a classroom full of students.  He came up from behind him and wrestled with him and tried to get the hand grenade off his hand. Unfortunately, the grenade was unpinned already and when it fell, it exploded and a shrapnel hit Ritchie from the base of his skull. In an instant, he died. When his Jesuit brothers were sorting through his belongings, they found his retreat journal.  And these words were written,  purpose. And I remember saying to myself then, whatever he had to give up his life like that, I wanted for myself too. And that's why I chose to become a Jesuit."
