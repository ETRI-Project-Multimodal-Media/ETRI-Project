Toe to toe. Mono a mono. This game's important because it puts us right back on track. Puts us right where we need to be. When you add a trophy to the game, it means that much more. It talks about rivalry.  Order States playing for a trophy which signifies victory. Everybody gets into this game. The players, our fans, even our managers. The winner of this game will be the most physical and the team that makes the most big plays. Who's gonna flinch? Who wants to win this game? It's big boy football.  you"
