  "transcription": " Are you tubers? We're here standing in front of a pomegranate shrub and we're going to be talking about pomegranates today. They are a really versatile shrub that you can grow here. We're in the southeast of the UK. At the moment it's in between flower, which you've got the flowers here, and in between growing of the fruit. I'll show you.  some more of them where they're starting to develop over the back. But they're really hardy, they can take temperatures down to sort of minus 10, minus 15 degrees easy because they go to sidious. They do well with the chill time anyway, they need the chill time to produce the fruit. But then they need a nice good warm location, like up against this brick wall here, to get a good amount of heat during the summer in order to produce the fruit. They're a really nice shrub, as you can see for the leaves. So they really have a nice  attractive appeal in the garden. If I take you around here slightly into the bush you can see somewhere amongst here, there's one here, you'll start to see the, it will start to develop as you can see into sort of a small pong around it and this will gradually, another one here, what this will do is it will gradually start to inflate, another one up there,  and they will inflate and become into your pomegranates that probably get to about a tennis ball size I reckon these ones do. They're very adaptable to most climates so yeah I'd recommend if you can, if you've got a space in your garden to plant a pomegranate they do really well. Take it easy."
