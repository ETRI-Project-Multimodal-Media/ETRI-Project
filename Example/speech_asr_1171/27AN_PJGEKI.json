  "transcription": " Okay, one thing you guys want to know about is how to set up this board. You got towards the sun is behind you. So I want to catch the most amount of reflection. So I'm always turning the board outward so I can catch that reflection and bring it up. Okay. And that's why you see a good reflection on  on the panel. It's not because it's tilted in because then it's not capturing the reflection and you will get the less amount of light on your panel. So you definitely want to get good light reflection right on your dent so you can see it good. These boards are meant to face the sun. So that means your back's got to be behind you or to the side, wherever the reflection's at. And the sun's going down but I'm still reflecting my board towards the light source so I'll get  a good amount of light on the panel."
