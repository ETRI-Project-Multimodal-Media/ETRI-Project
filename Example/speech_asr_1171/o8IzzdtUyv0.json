Somebody with Eritrea, somebody with Ghana, Nigeria and whatever. It was a meeting just to share the life that we have in New York, our experience, what we are doing in the arts, and also it's a meeting in which we are trying also to design our future and we are very focused on the future, so I hope that we will have a great future.  Hi, my name is Edynge Berselacce, I was born and raised in Italy, but my parents are from East Africa, Eritrea. I'm very happy I met so many European, Afro-Europeans today and I'm glad I met you, Kai, and again. It's great, thanks to Fred. I'm Fabio Inca, from Rome, I'm a personal trainer, a fitness expert, and this meeting was great, so all Afro-Italians in New York, great, I love it.  Hi everyone, I'm Valentino Agumo and I'm here at Union Square with friends.  Today we met, we chatted, we were all black but Italian and we had fun. We felt at home but in New York. We brought Italy here to New York. Foreigners, but in New York. It's nice to feel at home with people like you who understand what you feel, what you love and what you can share with simple people.  simplicity. It's been a great day and I hope we'll be able to do it again. See you later!  Toque lo que dices"
