  "transcription": " The change in our dollar forecast also affects other asset classes, as fluctuations in currencies in a low-yield environment can have a significant impact on total returns. After a strong start in the year, we are now expecting to see only moderate gains in equity  for the remainder of the year. Although many indices are climbing from one record high to another, stock market volatility hasn't been this low for years. Even so, we are not betting on continued low volatility, but instead prefer to hedge ourselves against potential market setbacks. At the same time, in light of our overall positive market outlook, we would continue to use any setbacks as buying opportunities. We see only a few factors in the next 12 months that could trigger  a sustainable correction in the equity markets. Our current favorites are Europe and Asia, whereas we have now underweighted the United States. In a fixed income area, we continue to expect an environment of moderately rising interest rates and therefore favor short-term maturities. In the United States and the Eurozone, we like investment-grade corporate bonds and prefer selected high-yield government bonds in the emerging economies. We also see dedicated real estate  and infrastructure investments as possible source for stable returns. Discover more at Deutsche AM.com"
