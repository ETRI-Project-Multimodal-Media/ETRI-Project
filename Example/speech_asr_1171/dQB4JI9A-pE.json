  "transcription": " So, I am a bug bounty hunter and I usually participate in bug bounty programs of Facebook, Facebook and Twitter.  one of the best bug bounty programs.  I got to know that security is very important. Then I searched on Google. I searched for the best security engineers in the world. After reading blogs, I got to know that there are such things.  .  and it went viral everywhere  security  is very cool. So this is my first company and I don't think I will get this kind of facilities anywhere in India. The other thing about Flipkart is Flipkart has never questioned me why are you doing hunting for Facebook and Twitter. Everyone appreciates me for finding bugs on other companies. They never told me not to find bugs on other companies, stick to Flipkart, these kind of no restrictions. So they always said you are doing something good.  Helping the web to be a safer place. Coming into doing bug bounties is a very difficult thing. In the very beginning you won't find any bugs on Facebook and other big companies. Start with small companies and take care of the legal thing. You should check if the company actually allows you to do a responsible disclosure. You are allowed to search for a bug on the company. Do not directly go and hack any  .  from other people. There is no concept of senior, junior. Learning opportunities are more. People help you wherever you are stuck."
