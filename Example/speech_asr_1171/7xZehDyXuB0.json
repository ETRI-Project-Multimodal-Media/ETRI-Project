  "transcription": " I live off...  This is Lavender Hill in Clapham Junction. As you can see right now, young people, they're all young, some of them very young, smashing in the windows here of Wimpy. Just over the other side, Ladbrokes, headmasters, hairdresser as well. And from where I'm standing here,  on Clapham Junction, they cannot see one policeman at all. They're all elsewhere in the city dealing with problems elsewhere. Let's move up here and see what's happening. This is quite extraordinary really. Every shot they can find they're looting. What are you guys up to? Is this fun? Is this fun? They're now going into Headmasters.  the hairdresser here. I mean this is just extraordinary stuff. I've never seen this before and I live down here in Clapham."
