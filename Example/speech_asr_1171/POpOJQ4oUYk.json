  "transcription": " Marking the neck out obviously. It is absolutely essential to have a sense of life.  in the center would be good. I prefer through neck designs because of the sounds that you get out of them really. You end up with a much warmer, more sustain-y sort of an instrument.  Which is... how I like it does to sound. I'll do a bolt on if you want one, because obviously we'll do whatever any customer could possibly want. We're good like that. Next up... Headstock. Roughly. I'm just doing the measurements here.  So I know that roughly that's the size of the headstock. Which means that's where the nut is going to go. From here I work out every other dimension of the neck. Again, making absolutely certain that everything is square. Now, for the documentation.  I can't build guitars without tea.  The first bit of excess wood to be removed is the area where the top will be and that effectively combined with the depth of the top wood itself gives us the break angle.  and outside dimensions of the neck are then cut in. Again I'm staying within a mil or two of the lines. This is knackering.  Mark the dress right up.  If you can't get a perfect joint without just the pressure of your  fingers and then you haven't done your job correctly. It's important the glue gets spread evenly and that there's no areas at all that aren't covered. If it's plain perfectly, the plain surface, with a sharp plane at least, plain surface  should be slightly shiny. I still have the position of the nut marked on the side of the neck.  becomes bloody lovely.  you"
