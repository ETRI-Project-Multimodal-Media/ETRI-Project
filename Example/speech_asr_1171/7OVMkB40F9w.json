  "transcription": " The news of the fire is not just about the fire, it's about the victims.  That's an issue that happens in Chapter 11. There's got to be a plan, a reorganization. It has to be a reasonable plan. And the creditors have an opportunity to either approve or disapprove that plan. So we'll see what PG&E's plan is and how they want to compensate the victims. I want the fire victims to know that just because PG&E's filing a reorganization doesn't mean that they're not going to get compensated. I know people are going to hear bankruptcy and people routinely hear bankruptcy and most people think of it as a Chapter 7  where somebody sells all their assets and there's nothing left and nobody gets paid. This is a reorganization, not a chapter seven. So the victims are still gonna be compensated for their losses. Customers really don't need to do anything. Customers don't really need to do anything. They went into bankruptcy before in 2001 and everybody's light stayed on. Everybody still got their gas service. There are people that wanna operate the company and can do it at a profit. So it's not gonna, like it's gonna go away. That's just not gonna happen.  you"
