  "transcription": " Yep. Alright, first thing you're doing is line up feet with the three point line. Line up elbow with basket. Balance ball on fingertips. Keep guide hand as straight as possible.

Then you're following through after your shot.  Always go after rebound. There you go. Alright, line up the feet with the free throw line. Elbow. Fingertips. Keep guide hand as straight as possible. Keep eye on rim at all times.  Don't shoot flat footed. Concentrate on your free throw. Shoot a peak of shot. Make sure you follow after your shot. And go after your rebound.  You want to see it?"
