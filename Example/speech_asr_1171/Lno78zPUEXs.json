  "transcription": " I'm Johnny Moore. I'm Viv McWatters. In our facilitation training we're going to share with you 20 years of experience of bringing meetings to life. It's not training as usual. We get you up, moving around, talking with each other, engaging and having fun. We use a whole range of techniques to do this to enable you to have conversations that matter and make the decisions that are important to you. We draw on ideas from improv theatre, psycho drama,  all sorts of places to help you develop presence and spontaneity as a facilitator. That's what's going to help you deal with unexpected situations and the inevitable, occasional, difficult people. And for me that is at the heart of facilitating, being alive to the group and to whatever is happening right there in the moment. It's how we first connected, it's why we continue to work together and we'd love to share it with you.  you"
