  "transcription": " Hey guys, what's up? I'm here to record a tutorial video on how to download music from YouTube.  I'm going to search the song you want.  Thanks to the transfer area, I think. And I'll see you later. After that, you'll go to the Google. I'll just edit a little bit of it. It's a little bit out of focus. I'll go to the website called YouTube MP3 Converter.  I'll put the link in the description. I'll click on convert to video. I'll click on the link. It's coming to the notification bar. No title. It will show the name of the song. And the download link.  And it's done. It's a sound. It's playing. I can't let it because there's copyright. So that's it guys, thank you very much for watching. If you liked it, click like. If you didn't like it, click dislike. But tell me why you didn't like it. And that's it, thank you very much for watching and I'm out!"
