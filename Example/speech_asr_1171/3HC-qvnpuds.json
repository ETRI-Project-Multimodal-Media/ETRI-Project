  "transcription": " Ava's here. Ava's in the house that you paid for with your contributions and we thank you for that. Where are my ladies at? Who's pussy stank out here? Come on, be honest. We really have a cream that we want to talk about with you. How many of you listen to the podcast? I am the only black people a lot of you know. I'm a good one. I don't know if you guys can relate to my struggle here in the Pacific Northwest. You're trying. Look at you. Look at this adorable blue-eyed angel.  Angel with dreadlocks. Where's the black person that taught you? Have you ever gone out with your homeboys? And they're all vegan and you're not? You're merely vegetarian. Trick em. It's like sliding off the condom. The condom off of a dairy product. Oh, we're really, we're really fleeking it up tonight, right? I can say whatever I want to, you don't actually know any of the slang terms. Ain't that some shit? That is some shit. Where do you keep your black people?  for you with my big dick mouth. I see you my brother. Here you go. Blink if you need help."
