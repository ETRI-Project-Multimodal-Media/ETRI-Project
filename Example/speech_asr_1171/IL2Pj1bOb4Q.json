  "transcription": " [♪ Music Begins ♪ and continues throughout video ♪  Personally, I owe a lot to Sam for the success of this film, not only because of his brilliant  performance, but because if he hadn't agreed to do it, honestly, I don't know what I would have done. So thank you, Sam, for saying yes, for trusting me. Thank you for letting me steal your voice. You know, in the movie, Jack may struggle with telling his brother how he feels about him. I've got no problem telling you, Sam, just how much I love and admire you. You are my brother.  Bradley, I don't think, you know, if you look what's behind me here, I'd say it's safe to say that the reason I'm here is because of your film. And I love you too, pal. You've given me a gift. You know, I've had a number of gifts the last few years. There's no question about it. I've had a lot of really nice films come my way.  work with some people I have the greatest respect for. I'm not sure that I've ever had an experience like I had on your film. It touched me in a way that, I don't know, it changed my life in some ways.  you"
