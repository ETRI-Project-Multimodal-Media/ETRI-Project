  "transcription": " Shockwave therapy is recently began to be applied for the treatment of such urological diseases as chronic prostatitis, chronic pelvic pain syndrome, benign prostatic hyperplasia, erectile dysfunction and Peyronie's disease. The mechanism of the action of shockwaves is as follows.  Under the influence of the shockwave therapy, vascular growth factors are produced in the organs and tissues, together with endothelial growth factor. This leads to tissue revascularization. The shockwave therapy also increases the mass cell activity in the tissue of the treated area. Mass cells then begin to secrete pro-inflammatory compounds, chemokines and cytokines.  and the stimulation of the process of healing and tissue regeneration. The influence of shock waves helps decrease the level of pain-mediator concentration in the tissues, so-called substance P. Thus, using the BTL shock wave therapy can improve blood flow, stimulate the healing process and tissue regeneration and improve the quality of life.  During the shockwave therapy session, the patient is lying on the couch with legs spread and bent at the knee and hip. An applicator with a diameter of 15 mm is used for the procedure. The treatment of prostate is carried out through perineum. The area of contact with the applicator has to be covered by a shockwave therapy gel. During the shockwave therapy session, the applicator is moved in a horizontal plane.  The first 500 pulses are delivered at an inclination of the applicator to the left, at an angle of 30 degrees. The next 500 pulses are delivered at an inclination of the applicator to the right, also at an angle of 30 degrees. The last 1,500 to 2,000 pulses are delivered from the central position of the applicator."
