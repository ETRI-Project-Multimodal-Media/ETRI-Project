Ahead of the game, we ain't asking to win. Evolution, every time we begin, we give in simpler and reinvent them. Seek the fresh and the youngest. As far as we can afford college, a war cry will be the loudest. Living to save you some knowledge. Freedom causes a fortune. Get off this. I'm marching. Our pigs be heavy upon us. So next time, we be launching. Shoot, that's why I got like COVID. Freedom or death, you know me. Under the rug, I'm a piece of the plate. And I can suck it right there off our state. Thousands of immigrants run off KKKs. Thousands of refugees can't get a break to your place. Place, place, place, place, place, place, place, place, place. 911, 9999.  Spirit!  So  so  So  so  so  so  do  Thank you."
