  "transcription": " They're gonna play their last game here in Edmonton. I know that they've been mortal enemies of the Oilers for many, many years, but we've also been able to appreciate and watch their skill level and how they affected and changed the game in a lot of different ways and we'll be able to appreciate them tomorrow night and  enjoy the evening. Last night in Vancouver it was very fitting that the game ended the way it did. There are a couple of tremendous individuals in the league and the hockey world has been very lucky to have them. It was a pleasure watching them play for seven, eight years before I got to the NHL. It was even more of a pleasure being able to compete against them in their prime.  you know, big, big influence on my hockey life. And like I said, it's a pretty special moment for me as a Vancouver kid. Get to play against them in their last NHL game. They meant a lot to me. Obviously, they're obviously world-class players. But obviously, when I got to Vancouver, I was young and into my NHL career. And they treated me like family. They're awesome guys away from the rink, on the rink. Obviously, the play speaks for themselves. But they're great people. And I think that's what everyone will tell you.  I watched Vancouver growing up and at that time they were coming up and they were amazing just watching them. It was so fun to watch. Anytime I got to go to games or anything, you always watch them. Even if you didn't want it, they did something special that got your attention. Just growing up and seeing that was really cool."
