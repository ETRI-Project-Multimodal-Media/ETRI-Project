  "transcription": " Dating back thousands of years, Newport has a history to rival any city in the UK. One of the furthest Roman outposts, Newport was established by the Romans in 74 AD and they went on to live in the area for another 300 years. There are plenty of Roman ruins on display in Newport including the Cilean Amphitheatre, barracks and baths. Here we are at the Roman Amphitheatre in Cilean which is just a short drive away from the hotel.  This is the entrance to the battle arena where the gladiators would have taken their first or last steps into the arena. At their peak, the huge amphitheater held 6,000 spectators watching gladiators battle it out. While the baths were the state-of-the-art for the time. Including an underfloor heating, hot and cold baths and an outdoor swimming pool. Make sure to check out the adjoining Roman National Museum as well. Just behind me we have the Roman Legionary Museum. Just a two-minute walk away from the amphitheater displaying over 60,000 Roman artifacts.  Closer to the center of town you'll find Newport Castle. Now an impressive ruin. The castle dates back to the 14th century and was once an imposing castle protecting the city from the riverbanks. Just behind me is what remains of the Newport Castle built in the 14th century. All that remains is the east section. Everything else was destroyed in the Civil War. Even older still is Newport Cathedral which originally dates back to the 5th century and has survived attacks by pirates and the Normans during its long history.  you"
