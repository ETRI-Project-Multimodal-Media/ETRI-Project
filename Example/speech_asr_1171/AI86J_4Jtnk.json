  "transcription": " So this morning what we did is we approached the judge and we read probable cause to the court and as part of our probable cause, yes, we believe that the evidence is pointing to Eric Black as the driver of the getaway vehicle in the shooting of Jasmine. It's just very heartfelt to know everybody wants the same thing I want justice for my baby.  and it is going to be just as far and I'm feeling in the bottom of my heart.  that this was a case of mistaken identity, that they fired in the vehicle believing that it was in retaliation for an altercation that had happened earlier in the night, not realizing that in fact Jasmine and her family were in the vehicle. No seven-year-old deserves this. No family deserves this, especially this time of year. And so I am happy that we have someone in custody at this point and charged.  I look forward to continuing our investigation and seeking justice for Jasmine. It gives some answers again, and I'm sure some solace at some point, but we must understand that the immediate concern of this family and Miss Washington is my child has a funeral tomorrow at 12 o'clock.  Okay."
