  "transcription": " Oh my God, guys. It's Ryan. Okay. I tried to call my wife, but her phone's off. She must be at work. It's Friday, June 21st. You guys are about to do the show.  and the only phone I could get was this one because all your phones are turned off. But I want to let you know that I was sexually assaulted by a wolf. That's why I'm not going to be on the show this week. I'm really scared. I can't get a hold of anybody. But the good news is I have a wife who would never see a zombie move around me. And also I have a bunch of comic books that no one would ever get rid of. And I can read them when I get back from the movies.  back into, uh, into... Oh my god, do you hear that? The wolf is here. I gotta hang up before it leaps the again. I'll see you guys next week. Hopefully."
