  "transcription": " In this one here, let me just explain really quick. For any self-defense movement that you're gonna do, try to do it in 3 seconds or less.  So you're gonna do something, do it fast. In this case, the attacker, Rami, was a lot bigger than I think. I didn't know what was going on. My awareness was dead. So I just saw the hand went up and down. Elbow, push, and hit. That was less than two seconds. Again, if you need to do something, do it fast. Fancy stuff just don't work. In a confrontation, you need to be fast.  you don't have any time to think. So you have to do something fast that works. Okay, let's try it again on this angle here, okay? Promise? Okay. There is not much I can do. I may be able to do a head bow, but in this case, hands up, body down. Ha! So I catch it. Elbow, deliver. Push. I kick. So that way I'm already in a fighting position where I can do whatever I want.  go to the throws, go, run, get help, whatever. So think fast, do it fast. By the way, if you like this video, subscribe, comment, and let me know. Thank you."
