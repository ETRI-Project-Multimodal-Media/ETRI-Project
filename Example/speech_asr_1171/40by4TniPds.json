Wash, wash, wash, they're nice and clean. Now we're ready to cook, they're nice and clean.  buttermilk pie! Ms. Yomikar, what are the ingredients? Thanks for asking, Ben! First we need three eggs. Then we need a cup of sugar. And then we need two tablespoons of flour. Looks like we need one cake of melted butter, and one cup of buttermilk, and one teaspoon of vanilla extract.  First you need a grown up to preheat the oven for 350 degrees. Let's get started with our recipe. First we'll put in the eggs, sugar, and flour.  Next we're going to put in the butter. And next the buttermilk. And next the vanilla egg.  It mixes the ingredients very well. Next we need to dust the pie crust with a little bit of flour.  And next you pour the batter into the pie shell. Now we have to sprinkle a little more flour on the top. Top it off with a little bit of cinnamon.  And now, get a grown-up to help you bake the pie at 350 degrees for one hour. When the pie is done, ask a grown-up to help you move out of the oven and let it cool. Mmm, this pie tastes as good as it looks. Where's the meat?"
