  "transcription": " The problem is how we manipulate the knowledge we have, not the knowledge. And we have to realize that potential is there for a better future or a worse future. Whether it's better or worse depends on us now. Let's prepare our minds now. This conference is not only Java. DevOps is a multi-track conference. You want to be here, you want to experience the positive vibe and actually meet people.  People come here because they expect to have the same quantity of speakers, of content, and I think that DevOps guarantees that the speakers will be among the best in the world. We have many, many speakers outside of Ukraine, so we come in on a global level, at least on the European level. DevOps is the greatest engineering conference in Ukraine, at least in my mind.  conferences a year because 365 days of the year you can't be excited all the time. But if you go to a conference, you get excited about the new technology and everything and you get to learn new people and talk about stuff and then you're excited again. You go back to work and you have more energy. It's a global conference. This mixing of local community and international community should bring the additional values for us and for promoting Ukraine in the Europe.  Very interesting to see how this event changed just in the last two years. DevOx is definitely a rock concert for technologists, for developers, and it's just a fun way to actually recharge your batteries on an intellectual level, but also on an emotional level. So it's a great experience. I'm very excited to be here and I hope that it's not the last time I come.  you"
