  "transcription": " I've always been a massive fan of Michelangelo and the Black Sea Gentlemen and they're a very dark, Baltic cabaret kind of band. They're certainly not a band for children. That's not the first thing that springs to mind when you listen to their music. But when I was doing one of the workshops for Masquerade, I just put their music on and I asked the actors to respond to it. And I got so much inspiration from watching these actors just improvise.  And after that I couldn't not listen to Michael Anton and the Black Sea Gentleman when I was writing. And then I thought I'd get a bit cheeky and actually write them into the play because I was imagining them as certain characters in the book. And I wanted those characters to have voices and I could only hear Michelangelo's voice or Rufino's voice or Guido Libido's voice. I could only hear their voices. And thankfully Sam Strong and Griffin went along with it. And so did the Black Sea Gentleman which was just the greatest gift of all to say  I want you to step off the Baltic Cabaret stage and into a children's play and they have embraced it."
