Welcome to the penthouse at number 66 Balaclava Road, right in the heart of Caulfield North and yet only a moment's walk to the vibrant Carlisle Street. A small select development of only three with the penthouse occupying the entire top two floors. This is an exciting property.  I can't wait to show you through, so let's go and have a look. The word penthouse is probably one of the most overused descriptions in real estate. Small apartments these days are labelled such. Having said that, the penthouse at 66 Balaclava Road is one of palatial proportions, beautifully set over two levels with all of the entertaining areas downstairs.  stairs, this property works incredibly well. The entertaining areas in this incredible apartment would rival most large family homes, whether it be this wonderful kitchen meals area, the family room, the formal lounge dining room. My favourite place though is the incredible undercover balcony.  The owner of this apartment has thought of absolutely everything. A secure lift to take you from the basement to the apartment and then once inside, should you wish to go to the main bedroom without taking the stairs, you've got your own private internal lift.  Penthouse living should never be a life of compromise. You need the perfect position, you need scale and you need luxury. Those three things are covered perfectly at number 66 Balaclava Road. If you're in the market for something truly special, please give me a call for a private inspection or I can't wait to see you at our weekend opens.  You"
