And the first thing you're going to do is make a slip knot. So go ahead and measure out about four feet of string.  and this is going to be your tail. So just kind of eyeball it. It doesn't really have to be exact. You just need to have a good length of yarn. So to make your slip knot, you need to form a circle. So just place one side over the other, so you have this. And then the part that's connected to the tail, pull it up through the middle of the circle and pull it tight. It doesn't have to be real tight.  a loose knot right there. And go ahead and slip that on your wrist. You don't want to keep it too tight on your wrist. It needs to be loose enough to slide back and forth, and you're going to be pulling it over your fist. So it needs to be snug, but not too snug, and this is going to determine the length of each loop on your scarf.  you"
