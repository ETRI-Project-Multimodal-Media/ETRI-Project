  "transcription": " Justin Bieber uses Twitter to say, finally we're talking about what's important, the music. What does he mean? Maybe he was just tired of the coverage he got after visiting a Houston, Texas strip club. Yeah, the pint-sized pop star was in the Lone Star State partying pretty hard at an area strip club and of course, he decided it would be a good idea to remove his shirt and let his pants hang off his backside. Because, you know, when in Rome. Oh, and don't worry.  He brought enough dollar bills with him to make it rain. According to reports, JB wasted no time shocking the strippers with his raunchy behavior, even allegedly touching one on her butt. That dancer used Twitter to tell everyone how it nearly made her faint, and that she's danced for a lot of celebrities and they don't usually phase her… but he had her in shock. Guess she does know he likes to urinate in mop buckets, show up two hours late for his own concerts, and lunge at photographers.  you"
