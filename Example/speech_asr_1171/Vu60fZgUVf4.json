  "transcription": " I'm Radia Scott Walker from Lexington, Kentucky. However, I grew up in rural Alabama during the segregated era. Grew up on a small farm, went to a segregated school, high school and college at Tuskegee University.  I lived through that period and I am so happy today that things have changed. Still problems, we face them every day, but things are changing. And I'm so happy that, and blessed, that after college I had a successful career. In fact, I have served at two major universities as a  vice president. So I've seen freedom, I've experienced segregation, and I'm happy things have improved and look forward to a better day. That's right. I too am American.  you"
