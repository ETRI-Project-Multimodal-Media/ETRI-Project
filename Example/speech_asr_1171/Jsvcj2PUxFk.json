  "transcription": " Nearly all the world's most significant challenges, from sustainable energy to clean water, rely on the development of new materials. Nuclear power, oil and gas, aerospace, these are all sectors where failure is simply unacceptable. Through the design of new materials,  able to make aero engines, for example, which are able to work under harsh conditions for many thousands of hours. It's only through understanding how damage occurs and how to avoid it that we can ensure safe flight for everyone. I am lucky enough to have some of the best X-ray equipment in the world. This, alongside with some of the most powerful electron microscopes, allows us to build up an unrivaled picture of the behavior of materials.  Graphene was first isolated here in Manchester and we're now leading the research into this new material, leading to a whole range of new devices that will completely transform the world we live in. Materials research at Manchester is really gaining pace with the BP International Centre for Advanced Materials, the National Graphene Institute, the Graphene Engineering Innovation Centre and most recently the Sir Henry Royce Institute for Advanced Materials, we have a wonderful opportunity to  to make a powerhouse for new materials here in Manchester. Furthermore, it brings together some of the brightest minds from across the country. We have physicists, chemists, biologists, medics, material scientists and engineers all working together to design the materials of the future.  you"
