  "transcription": " Well, thanks for joining my channel. What I'm all about is sharing toys that I've been collecting for over 30 years. So I've got Matchbox, I've got Hot Wheels, I've got Fat Tracks, all sorts of things, launchers and planes, cars and boats and motorbikes. And as you can see, I've got a bit of a collection over these years. So what I want to do is share these collections. I'm even going to open things that are really rare. And if you look through my  channel you will see that there's a lot of things you might have had when you're a kid or you young blokes never knew that they made all these toys so I'm going to share it with you so have a look around and then hopefully you like my channel and give me a thumbs up and I'll just keep on keeping on. Thanks for watching.  Hey! Hey! Let's roll! Hey! Hey! Go for it! Hey! Hey! Let's roll! Hey! Team Hotswim!  Hey.  So, what do you think?"
