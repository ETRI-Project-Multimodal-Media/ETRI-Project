  "transcription": " I'm Michael Davison, Managing Director of First Aid for Sport and this is the First Aid for Sport wobble board. It's a lightweight plastic wobble board that's used to help strengthen weak ankles and core muscles. What you do is you simply place one foot on, place the other foot on and then you can balance on it and you can set your feet as wide apart  as you like, the wider apart the easier it is to balance. And then you simply can rock back, forwards, side to side. And the idea is that you try and keep the rim of the balance board off the floor, which then helps your thighs, your calves, your ankles, but also your stomach muscles and your back. As you can see, I'm not very good at it, but it really is a good exercise for  foot, an old body workout for great value. So that's the first day of the sport wobble board."
