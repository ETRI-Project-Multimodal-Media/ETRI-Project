I meant the food on your plate. Yeah, I sweet-talked the cafeteria lady. I told her that her hairnet really brought out the sparkle in her eye.  Thanks. Can I get a taco for the teapot? Uh, the teapot has a name. It's Sunny. Yes, you are. But what's your name? Smooth. Yes, I am. But you can call me James. Hey, got her to make me a rack of lamb. Man, I love lamb! Well, stick with me, man. You'll have a great time here. Sunny. Chad. Anyways, they're shooting our scene. We should probably go. Oh, you're on McKenzie Falls this week?
