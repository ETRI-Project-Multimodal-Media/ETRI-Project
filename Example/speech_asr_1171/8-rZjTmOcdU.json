  "transcription": " Intro  FIFA  and  I'm not sure if I can get in the Stuttgart side  currently not in the lineup for the opening fixture. So, I'm kind of questioning, do I go on loan to gain experience? I'm 70 rating now, got some pretty good stats. Let me know in the comments below, really want to get your opinion on it. So our first game we did, to be honest, average. We did it out of a 5.3 rating and it didn't look good whatsoever. But here's our upcoming objectives against Upper Games. We could get a few things, a few games actually. So guys, let me know  know in the comments below should I go out on loan I've sent requesting to see the man should consider it but let me know in the comments and while you're down here make sure you leave a like and thanks for watching bye"
