  "transcription": " So what we're seeing today is the construction, the excavation of the new Northern Line southbound running tunnel which is running parallel to the existing tunnel in the station between Monument and Bank Station. So we're digging the tunnel  as part of the Bank Station Capacity Upgrade Project, which is currently seeing a footfall of about 450,000 people a day. A heavily congested station right in the centre of the City District of London. We're working along beside the station, keeping it running whilst we dig the tunnels beside the station. Quite a long programme, and then we'll be connecting into the existing station with the minimum disruption in about two or three years' time.  so  You  you"
