  "transcription": " The first revelations spoke of Germany spying on a fellow NATO member. Now German media have named the country as Turkey. Some lawmakers are astonished that Ankara has been an official intelligence gathering target for at least five years. It would be good if the government could convincingly explain why, and to what degree, Turkey is  he  Hillary Clinton in 2012. Berlin insists the recordings were not deliberate. But instead of being immediately deleted, the recordings were retained and analysed. The political damage has been done. The United States can now say that Berlin is guilty of spying too. Kerry is said to have enjoyed pointing that out to his German counterpart Frank-Walter Steinmeier.  This may well explain why the German government has had so little interest in really uncovering the NSA scandal. And why they've been so soft on the United States. They simply have had a bad conscience. Berlin has not issued an official statement."
