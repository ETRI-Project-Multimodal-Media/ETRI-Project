  "transcription": " Hold me close till I get up Time is barely on our side I don't wanna waste what's left The storms we chase are leading us And love is all we'll ever trust, yeah  What's left? We'll go Through the wastelands to the highways to my shadow through the sunrays  Finding life along the way melodies we haven't played  I don't want no rest Echoing around these walls Fighting to create a song I don't wanna miss a beat And on and on we'll go Through the wastelands, through the highways Through my shadow, through the sunrays And on and on we'll go  Through the wastelands, through the highways And on and on we'll go  See the horizon turn us to thousands and we'll grow We'll go  To the sun rays"
