  "transcription": " I'm Bruce Cotton and I've been a customer here for about three years now. There's nothing quite like this place. It's honestly good restaurants around town, but nothing can really match Fazo's to me. Pizza's great. They got a great beer selection here. Wings, even better. And just the atmosphere around here, it's great. Middle campus, great place to be to watch the game. They have a pint night every Wednesday and you get to try a different beer every Wednesday. You get to keep the pint line open.  last friend coming. Yeah, I'd recommend Pawsys to all my friends and family."
