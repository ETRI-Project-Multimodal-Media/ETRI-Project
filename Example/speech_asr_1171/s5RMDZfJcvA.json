Put them through some really cool activities as far as getting their bodies warmed up and doing some exercises that not only  not only work the body, but also work the mind. Our awesome host, Gia Peppers, she actually introduced me to about 200 students and we kind of were talking in regards to the Fuel Up to Play 60 element. The Play 60 was me, but I also had some special guests. I brought along some dairy farmers with me and they were talking about fuel. It's important to have a happy, healthy cow because they produce healthy milk and healthy milk is what helps us stay strong. So then we went into three breakout sessions. One was an innovation station.  We gave kids an opportunity to win $500 for their school. Kind of like the TV show Shark Tank, the kids broke up into groups and we sat there and listened to the kids present what they would do for their school for that $500. We are in here having hip-hop, hip, getting their heart rate up, sweating, and having a good time.  Having the kids understand how they can go online and interact with the playbook as far as helping not only themselves but also their fellow students. I would say it was a rousing success. When you're talking about a training camp, this is about educating kids as far as not only just from a diet standpoint but also the physical activity. But then we sent them on their way with a great lunch. They're ready to go out there and be, I think, really some productive kids in their respective schools.  you"
