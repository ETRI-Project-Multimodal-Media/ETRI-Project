  "transcription": " Good morning, Luke Smith here sponsored by Diary Rebel. I'm not sponsored by Diary Rebel but I would fucking love it if I was. Now, do you ever have those days when you're trying to write and you feel like the world is just saying, fuck you asshole. Well, don't worry about that anymore because today I'm going to show you where you can find a system that is going to help you turn all of it around.  Fuck you asshole!  it's only about like a quid on Amazon or maybe like two dollars or something and the reason I liked it was go and check it out, download it, have a read of it, it's very to the point. The first third of the book is all about increasing your output and your actually writing. The final two thirds are about planning your book. Now for me, my planning side of things is okay but it's avoiding those days where you just wanna, you find yourself procrastinating.  I read that first third in about 20 minutes, half an hour. Got everything I needed out of it. You know, there's a lot of YouTube videos and books about that kind of thing. There's a lot of messing around, a lot of filler that doesn't really get to the point. So that's 2,000 to 10,000 words. Check it out. Let me know what you think."
