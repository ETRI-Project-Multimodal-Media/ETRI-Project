  "transcription": " We all love the outdoors, nature and daytime in general. And we certainly spend a lot of time indoors with all kinds of light sources. This Paclite product is amazing, but it isn't a flashlight. It also never needs batteries. In fact, all it ever needs is light to recharge itself from any source. The best source is daylight.  for only a few minutes. It can hang inside your tent and get fully recharged. Even if you are in a cave for days, it will constantly glow. Leave it as a trail marker, a cave tracer, a nightlight for your children. Hang it next to a light switch that is hard to find in the dark. Take it underwater. It is very lightweight.  and fits easily in your backpack, sleeping bag, or a rolled up tent. It is truly amazing, as it will work for you forever. In fact, our camping testers use it as a constant light source in their tents all night long. It makes it bright enough to see what's going on in the tent, but not so bright as to keep you awake. The real test of the pack light is in total darkness, and preferably in an enclosed space,  get more reflectivity and most importantly when your eyesight is adjusted to the dark then you will understand this amazing product better. Remember the pack light will recharge even if it's cloudy or left in your tent. Enjoy this great new product.  you"
