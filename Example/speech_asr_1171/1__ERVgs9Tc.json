  "transcription": " I found a love for me Darling just dive right in and follow my lead I found a girl Beautiful and sweet I never knew you were that someone waiting for me  We were just kids when we fell in love Not knowing what it was I will not give you up this time Darling just kiss me slow Your heart is all I own And in your eyes you're holding mine  Maybe I'm dancing in the dark With you between my arms Barefoot on the grass Listening to our favorite song When you said you loved the mess I whispered underneath my breath You heard it, darling you look  Perfect tonight I found a woman Stronger than anyone I know She shares my dreams I hope that someday I'll share her home I found a love To carry more than just  My secrets to carry love to carry children of our own We were still kids, but we saw Fighting against all lies I won't be alright this time Darling just hold my hand be my girl I'll be  Baby  Baby  With you between my eyes Barefoot on the grass I long desired it You look perfect tonight  you"
