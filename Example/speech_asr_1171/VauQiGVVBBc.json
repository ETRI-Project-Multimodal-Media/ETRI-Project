  "transcription": " Hey guys, this is Chris again with Reliable Computer Repair. Today we have Maria. She just walked in. Say hi Maria. Hi guys. Just brought her laptop in and we're going to go ahead and clean it up, speed it up for her. It's a remarkable little device that I've discovered and it is called Extra PC. It's a USB stick, a normal USB drive and on this drive is an entire  Operating system. Let's see how long it takes to boot. Here we go. Wow. Hopefully you're still with me. That took a long time. So we find our USB port that we want to use. Hit the power button.  and start hitting the F12 key. It'll bring up a menu that you need. There it is. That was super fast. We're going to go ahead and take the down arrow to USB storage device and hit enter. And then watch the magic. Boom. That was fast. Oh my gosh. Such a difference. An office always took forever. Let's see. Oh my gosh.  All right guys, there you have it, the Xtra PC. Tune in next time for another episode of Simple Computer Fixes. This is Chris saying bye for now."
