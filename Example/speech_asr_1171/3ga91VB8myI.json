That's why the CTS's available glide-up navigation screen is so essential. Plus, I get to control my entire audio experience using its 8-inch touchscreen. But what I like best about it is the fact that it's there to help me find my destination when I need it. But when I don't, it disappears. So I can enjoy the view.  you"
