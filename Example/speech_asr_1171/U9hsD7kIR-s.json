  "transcription": " When you're converting to single speed you have basically three choices on the sort of wheels that you want to have. You could have fixed gear wheels which means for every rotation of your crankset your back wheel is going to spin. So you're pedaling all the time, you're pedaling uphill, downhill, on the flat and you're probably actuating your brakes just by sort of locking your knees. That's fixed gear bike.  single speed bike, which means that you don't have to be pedaling all the time. You can sit there and you can coast along. But then to activate your brake, you typically use a handbrake. Guys will keep a front brake and a rear brake. What we do a lot at Coasties is we do coaster brake. So that means it's the same as when you were a little kid and you'd have forward, you'd pedal forward, and you could coast for a while. And then when you wanted to stop, you just step backwards on the pedal and it does that fat skid thing that you used to love when you were a kid.  Anyway, so these are the wheels we're putting on the bike today."
