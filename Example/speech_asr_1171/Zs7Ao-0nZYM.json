We're a home mission, supportive church and this week we're in the middle of doing a holiday at home for the over 50s. This is something we've done for the last three years and you see behind me, hopefully there's a hive of activity as people come and enjoy fun, games and just have a good time together.  This is lovely and I've been coming now for three years. What we're doing is it's not sort of preaching but it's sharing God's love in practical ways and that's our theme for the year is being salt and light.  It's a place for friendship and sharing and supporting each other and people are wanting to come now. They're asking when's the next thing and this is what you've got to do really is to not just have a one-off but think well what do we do next?  and keep that momentum. I would encourage people to do it. It is enjoyable, it's hard work, but it is enjoyable. Yeah, so if you're a church like us, a small church,  limited resources in an estate, in a community where perhaps there are lots of people who are on their own, who are elderly. This is something that's relatively easy to do and simple to do and it works. People come, people have a good time and over a period of time you can really build up relationships with people in the community.  just one of the many things that our churches do as they reach out to their communities. Westview is one of our churches supported by Home Mission. It's an expression of our family support for one another as we pray for one another, support one another, as we give to enable ministry to take place in so many churches. So we enable that to happen there at Westview. Thank you for your support for our Baptist family.  you"
