  "transcription": " So in the SnowPro package versus the LXR you get a little shorter windshield and then in the ski shocks we have a new shock coming out now for 2017 called the Fox Zero 1.5 RC. Gives that customer a little more options for the actual calibration of the shock itself. And in the skid frame we still have  of the Articat 1.5 IFP shock and the rear track shock is a Articat 2.0, which means it's a two inch body. So it's a good shock for when you're going through a lot of big bumps. You can have a Snow Pro in either 129 inch length or a 137 inch length. In the 129 inch length, you can get the Ripsaw track. The 137 comes with a Ripsaw too and they're both inch and a quarter plugs. That package with the Snow Pro is really geared towards a more aggressive rider, but not so aggressive  of that it sacrifices his ride quality in the lesser bumps or the lower speeds."
