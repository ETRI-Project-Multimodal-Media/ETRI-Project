  "transcription": " So we're now waiting for the sun to rise. And now all we can see is fog. I'm mistakenly into pictures of the wrong Mount Bromo. The smell is burning. It's almost midnight, which normally would be a good time to go to bed. However, someone is about to pick me up for a tour to see the sunrise at Mount Bromo, which of course won't happen in a couple of hours. So I guess no sleep for me tonight.  So happy with my tea So we're now waiting for the sun to rise. We've arrived here around 3 a.m. And the sun won't rise until 5.30, so I don't really get why we were here so early It's also super cold, which is kind of weird here in Indonesia But yeah, can't wait to see it. Sun, come up  So right now all we can see is fog so I'm really hoping that once the sun is really up we can actually see something. Otherwise it was a very long night for nothing. So it's time to leave. No sunrise, no view. Let's hope the next stop will be better.  A bit later, but this is what we were supposed to see.  Last crater, one more to go.  So I missed the sunrise. I mistakenly took pictures of the wrong Mount Bromo. But now I'm at the top of the real one, at the edge of the crater. It's just, the smell is burning.  so  you"
