  "transcription": " I'm Sean Finland. I'm the co-founder and CEO of Cloud Commodities Exchange, CCEX. We are a marketplace exchange for commoditized cloud computing resources. My name is Johannes Watzl and I'm the CEO of CCEX.  I did my PhD on commoditizing cloud computing and creating an exchange for trading cloud resources. In 2009 I met Sean and we since then started to work on the cloud exchange. My name is Karl-Michael Molzer, I'm the CFO here. I met Sean and Johannes roughly two and three years ago. I'm responsible for the whole funding process as well and basically reaching out to various stakeholders, getting all of the  on board. As John already mentioned we are talking to cloud providers, cloud consumers, banks, settlement partners, basically creating a totally new asset class. At the moment we are working to create the standardized products together with our ecosystem partners such as cloud consumers, cloud providers and intermediaries.  CCEX is focused on a 250 billion dollar market with 20% annual growth. We're looking to create a new asset class that is needed by all industries worldwide. Our goal is to create transparency in two phases. First as a OTC or over-the-counter contract. The second phase will be through standardized contracts through already existing financial exchanges worldwide, such as the Deutsche Börse as an example.  TQ is the FinTech hub in Europe, especially since Brexit. And just a great ecosystem. I mean, as you know, we have big players here, such as EY, KPMG, Deutsche Börse, Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank. These are actually ecosystem players we are talking to. So for us and I guess for other FinTech companies, TQ is the best place to be in Europe.  you"
