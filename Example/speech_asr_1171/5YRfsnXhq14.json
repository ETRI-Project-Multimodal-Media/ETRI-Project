  "transcription": " Hello folks, Geno here with American Motorcycle Trading Company in Arlington, Texas with a 2011 Harley-Davidson Fat Bob with very, very low mileage. I think this bike's got less than 100 miles on it. They haven't even rubbed the knobs off the tires yet, the factory tires. It's got dual front disc brakes, aluminum slotted mags, black powder coated lowers, dual headlights. This bike is a really nice bike. Chubby pull-back drag bars. It's got the denim finish.  53 miles is all it's got on it. Blacked out motor. Just in really, really fine shape. It's light new. Comes with a 96 inch motor and a 6 speed. Fire it off and let you listen to it. That's the factory exhaust on it.  So it runs pretty quiet, comes with forward mount foot controls. Just a really nice bike. If you'd like to know more about it, call our sales team toll free at 888-400-1151 or go online and see our complete inventory at cleanharleys.com.
