  "transcription": " Emily Lineman is fighting osteosarcoma, which is cancer of the bones. The prognosis is not good. So Emily has begun proactively checking things off of her bucket list. She's ridden a motorcycle, played basketball, gotten a tattoo. She even had a wedding. But one thing the Missouri teen was unable to do was watch her favorite St. Louis Blues play in person. Emily was gifted tickets, but when game time rolled around,  she was too sick to attend. So the Blues decided to give her one better. Alex Steen, David Backus, and Alex Petrangelo surprised Emily at her home, where they hung out and talked about tattoos, pet pigs, and of course, hockey. Those are a few of the reasons why we love sports today. If you have other stories you'd like us to share, post them to Twitter or Facebook using the hashtag WWLST."
