  "transcription": " Speed training  sprints or adding another form of resistance like a weighted sled. In this session I performed eight reps accelerating through to top speed. Again the emphasis was on performing the reps with a smooth relaxed technique.  Holo Sprint. Holo Sprint training is when your sprint rep is followed by a holo rest period of walking or jogging. This would be appropriate for any Invasion Games player that would need to perform at a variety of different speeds throughout a match. In this session I performed short sprints with a holo period of jogging.  so  Interval Training for Speed Interval training for speed will differ from training for endurance by working for shorter high-intensity reps followed by longer periods of rest. In this interval session I performed 10 reps of this short sprint with one minute of recovery in between each rep. If I was performing longer sprint reps I would increase the rest time.  Bye!"
