  "transcription": " We bring together some of the passionate changemakers from South Auckland with some people from that maker movement, both locally from Auckland but also from Brazil.  People have the answers to their own challenges. And it's simply our role for people that live outside the community to be alongside.  to ask good questions until the point that we're no longer needed. We just need to understand that only we can change who we are. There's a little saying in our community, only the hood can change the hood. All the ingredients for that transformation already exist in abundance. In South Auckland, it's about nurturing creativity and that sense of being able to make things be entrepreneurial and enterprising. Young people have got so much firepower  and energy in there. When a child is born into the village, the whole village celebrates because the whole village knows that here we have potential that has been born into the village that the village is going to benefit from. Growing up here in South Auckland, I've seen that when we have purpose, we are unstoppable."
