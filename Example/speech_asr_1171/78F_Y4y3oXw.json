So all of those items are packed up on this truck. The truck is driven down to Arizona. It'll leave today, it'll probably arrive depending on the weather on Sunday to our facility there, Maryville Baseball Park. The sausages and Bernie Brewer, they also visit spring training as well. So we pack them up on the truck. They also kind of help a little bit. Sometimes they get in the way.  kind of awkward but they do a great job. So they come with us and they help load the truck as well. It's a tradition that we started a couple years ago. I know it's been a tough winter. It's been cold, it's been snowy and if there's one thing that ends winter it's baseball. This is definitely a sign that the winter is soon to be over. Baseball is right around the corner so that gives hope for everyone."
