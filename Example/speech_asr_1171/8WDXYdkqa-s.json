  "transcription": " T-Series! It's your big day! Incredible job! I know we had our differences, but today, I just wanna tell you!  Now you're at number one, hope you did nothing wrong like starting your business by selling pirated songs. Oops, didn't think we'd see. It's right there on Wikipedia. Get used to your past being held against you by the media. I'm sure right now there's nothing that you're doing that's illegal. Yeah.  I'm certain that you haven't had collusions with the mafia For legal reasons that's a joke For serious Indian mafia Please don't kill me that's a joke India I'm sorry about the memes You're the best I'm all my Indian bros From Bombay to Bangladesh I'll take on all the world for you I'm a heavy hitter About to cause a genocide So you can call me  Congratulations, congratulations Congratulations, congratulations  a problem with me telling them to hold their defecation but let me educate you silly that's not defamation  We'll solve your crippling poverty But looking good, T-Series passed I'm guessing, not probably But never mind the poor people We just hit a party Just hit a pot some bottles With a nine-year-old army Non-alcoholic, cause I had a real problem But we still out here livin' like we bout to kamikaze  It's the end of the reign of Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg. Through all the change and controversy, you've been by my side. There's no army in the world. I would rather give me a watch time. It's been a wild ride, so while I can still be heard, here's one last brofist from the number one in the world.  Congratulations, it's a celebration I just wanna tell you that I think that you're amazing Congratulations, congratulations Congratulations, congratulations Congratulations, congratulations Congratulations, congratulations Congratulations, congratulations Congratulations, J-Series You did it!
