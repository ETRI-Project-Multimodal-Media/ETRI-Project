  "transcription": " Hey, what's up little buddy? You look like someone just downvoted your gif. One guess. Budget. Budget? Backup and recovery eat my resources, so I throw more resources at them and they eat those too. You're in the right line. Hello. You're talking budget, right?  How do I explain this in short words? Okay, these guys give you a lot more functionality and it costs less. Like you pay less and get... more? Across virtual, physical, and cloud. On any platform or application you throw at it. And it can grow with you to handle archiving, e-discovery, compliance, all that. Yeah, well everyone says they cost less, but then you gotta buy D-Doop appliances, third-party software licenses... Yeah, that's the other guys. No hidden costs? Not with Commvault. It can actually help you reclaim and redeploy  wasted resources and extend the life of your current infrastructure. So you can scale with fewer servers and less complexity and lower... TCO! See? You get it. All you're really looking for is a cost-effective way to support fully integrated, converged, and hyper-converged infrastructures to protect your workloads with asynchronous, near real-time recovery through scripting that automates the orchestration of cloud, physical, and virtual platforms. Oh, line's moving.  That will be my new ringtone."
