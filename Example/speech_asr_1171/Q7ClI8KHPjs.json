  "transcription": " Is that? Twilight Sparkle come to life. Are you a brony? Dude, we're brony bros. Oh my god! Why? Why would he do that? Hello, John. You know, tonight really isn't the night to celebrate, Sarah.  The darkness... it's rising. Stop playing tiddlywinks with them missus and get ready for the fight that's coming. Seen enough horror movie trailers to know this won't end well. Hello! What in the Disney hell is this? Now, there's magic. Ray, that's you! Magic? You see, last year there was a time deal.  And in order to kill him, the legends broke his prison, which surprise surprise released an unknown number of other dangerous magical beings. All of whom got spat out across the timeline and now must be hunted down and sent to hell. That's a stupid plan.  PR camp counselors. Cheers, lads. One thing I learned from the Czech movies is the doll always comes back. Wrong doll, you dick! You've lost a haircut. Finally lost it. I don't know if you happen to notice, but I'm a grown-ass superhero. Gary, put your nipple away. That was too much, right?  That is some great air magic right there."
