This is kind of the newest technology.  It's got the dual latenic 445 nanometers 460 nanometers blue and then it's also got the dual daylight 8,000 K and 12,000 K white So I'm very excited to see how this is gonna look Let me go ahead and flip it around here. Can you guys see what's going on? Okay, you guys should complete 24-hour control dawn dusk and moon lights  Wireless control. Supposed to be a very thin unit. I did get the 18 inch to 24 inch. You got your on and off, core automation. You got some of the features that it has from the very high end LED lighting. So I'm going to go ahead and  take it out of the box and lay it on the table and I'll be right back. Alright guys. Okay we're back here. Got everything unboxed. This thing looks incredible. There's your Ramp Up Time Pro. You got some velcro so you can stick it on the back of your ramp timer and adhere it to your cabinet.  And then you got the remote control. Very nice. Now if you notice you have the dynamic modes here. So you got your cloud covers, different cloud covers, your moonlight, and you got your thunderstorms, or lightning storms I should say. So, that looks really neat. You got your booklet, you got your power supply, of course your main unit here.  Look how thin this is. That is a thin profile right there. That's crazy. And then we flip it over. And then there's your LEDs. If I'm not mistaken, I believe there's 72 total. I could be wrong, but I thought that's what there was, about 72 total. So, it looks very nice. I'm gonna go ahead and plug it in and  mess around with it and see what we got alright thanks guys  so  So"
