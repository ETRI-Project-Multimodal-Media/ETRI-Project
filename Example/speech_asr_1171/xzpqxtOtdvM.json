The single mother of two is a fashion designer from Syria, now an asylum seeker in Italy's fashion capital, Milan.  When she was 23, Lamia visited Rome, Paris and London with her parents. 26 years later, she's back in Italy, this time as a single mother with two children, Hassan and Darin. They spent over a month in the back of a lorry crossing Sudan and Libya, before they took four boats to cross the Mediterranean.  Lamia chose Milan for her family, forgetting that the city had a lot to offer her. The journey from Sicily to Milan wasn't easy either.  The family now lives in a reception facility, waiting for their asylum papers to be processed. They survive on a small allowance and clothes donated by the public to the centre. After missing three years of school because of the war, Hassan and Darin will finally go back to their home.  back to school this September. Their mother is one step ahead. A keen student at the language class, she's eager to learn and integrate.  I want to find a job, start my own business, and build my own house. That's my ambition. Lamia plans to advertise her skills in the local paper so she can go back to designing women's clothes. She hopes to use what the city has to offer to regain for herself and her children some of what they lost."
