Okay, ready, set, go.  Josh is on number two  Dante's on number two  I'm gonna fall.  Josh is on number four Number four for Josh  No drink  We get screwed up in here  And Josh the first unfinished  Are you done don't stand up until you're done  Help stick in your mouth  Who's gonna be in third place?
