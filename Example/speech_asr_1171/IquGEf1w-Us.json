  "transcription": " You  About four, maybe four or five years ago, this was the tournament in Holland, under 21s, when I was backup keeper at Scottie Carson. Stir crazy, no games. Made him a newer film, this, in his hotel room. And it was a move that I'd pulled out in Magaluf about two months previous. Two weeks, two hours solid of this raving.  That is what Red Bull does to you. I can't believe they blocked Chiefy out there. Aggressive dancing.  Oh, no, might have a sniff here. Oh, see a palt. Foot down. The running robot. Look at righty. Quick, yeah? Burned. And there. Decent.  the five minutes previous to that. It's a song that I've been buzzing off for a little bit and yeah as soon as the game finished. The thing was, previous to it I'd done the interview against Man United in the semi-final and they held on to me and held on to me and held on to me. I didn't get to celebrate with any of the lads. So I just want, it was ESPN and yeah so I just wanted to make a bit of a mockery of the interview if I'm honest.  and have a bit of fun. Me and Jono have celebrated to that song a few times. My sister's fiancé texted me saying great overhead kick the other day and I didn't have a clue what he was on about. And yeah, I went and spoke to the Spielbergs in there and they told me about it. Ridiculous. What's going on here? Great ball in, Gunnar, I think he might have saved it. He weren't ready for this. Bam!  They've not filmed it but there was an awful lot of singing and dancing after that. Look at that, hold on. I'll get the height. Enough said."
