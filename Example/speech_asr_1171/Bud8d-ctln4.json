  "transcription": " Hey Ryan, what did you do this weekend? You won't tell, I went golfing. Played horribly. I went to shoot like 121. I know your pain, brother. How about you? What did you do? I went fishing. All day. Nothing. Nothing. Never caught a thing. Like us? We're using bait? We used everything. We threw everything we had at them except the kitchen sink. Didn't get nothing.  Fishing and golfing? False!  I think we can get this figured out. I think this is going to work.  So we need something to put that in. Can someone grab that? That'll work. What do you think of that? Does it go on the top or the bottom? Oh yeah it goes on the bottom there. I think we got it. That'll work eh? Let's go fishing.  And I was following it!  Okay, we're going out past the barge this time. Wow! Nice! Woo! Wow!"
