  "transcription": " Everything is ready for voters to cast their ballots. Expectations are high for a new president as Tunisia is stumbling to democracy. It's a tight race between prominent figures and political novices for the top job. Poles give a slight advantage to imprisoned Nabil Karawi. He's in jail over charges of tax evasion and money laundering. One of his opponents is the sitting prime minister Yusuf Shahid.  Other potential frontrunners are Abdel Fattah Marou, parliament speaker from the conservative Ennahda party, and Abdelkarim Zbidi, the current defense minister. Campaigning in these elections was loud, not just at rallies, but also on social media. For the first time ever, Tunisia held a televised debate, a milestone barely seen in North Africa.  It's the second time in Tunisia's modern history the voters have a chance to take part in a multiple candidate election. Tunisians are choosing their new leader at a time when their support for democratic institutions is dropping. Many have grown disillusioned, feeling the goals of the 2011 revolution have never been fully met. And that's a better economy and more jobs. Unemployment is high, 15 percent, and even higher in the northwest. And that's driving young people out of the country,  mostly through illegal migration.  Next month, Tunisians will also choose new members of parliament. It will be another chance for Tunisians to shape the future of the country. Axel Zajmovic, TRT World, Tunis."
